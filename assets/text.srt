1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,360
who's so curious what who Conor's gonna

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,580
fight I wonder I wonder if he looks at

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,319
Michael Chandler because at one point I

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:10,080
mean Chandler throws bombs but he throws

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,960
hooks he throws some fire like how does

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,519
the usada thing work

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,260
I guess he's not even in the in the pool

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,240
anymore if he's not in the pool so how

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,580
much time does he need before he gets

10
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,560
back and competes once he gets I think

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,500
six months six months yeah that's a long

12
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,500
time yeah so do you think his leg's

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,000
still [ __ ] up what do you think is

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,439
going on

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,600
I have no I don't even have thought I

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,460
don't know it's hard to say I mean I

17
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,899
don't know why he was out of the pool I

18
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:38,640
don't know if they took him out because

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,200
he's on a [ __ ] yacht everywhere and

20
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,600
he's just untestable like what are your

21
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,920
[ __ ] how are you gonna test him if he

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,600
doesn't that doesn't seem fair and it's

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,059
crazy I mean I I literally don't think

24
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,219
he's getting I don't think he got tested

25
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,140
last year so whatever it was no I don't

26
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,579
think he got tested so this year he

27
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,000
jumps back into the pool in December

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,340
January February March April May you can

29
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,199
fight in June July yeah

30
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,420
if he gets back in December which is

31
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,540
soon yeah and if he does who does he

32
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,680
fight but that's something that people

33
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,180
need to realize when they toss names

34
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,520
around yeah like if you're tossing I

35
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,900
want Conor I'm kind of like you're

36
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,580
talking about six months from now

37
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,200
minimum

38
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,000
which might work out for Chandler after

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,580
going through that War I I'm Conor has

40
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,780
to see a guy that's gonna get him

41
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,180
excited that he sees very winnable in my

42
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,140
like and Chandler's dangerous but he's

43
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,119
shorter and he throws [ __ ] hooks

44
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:31,860
Connor's up bigger and he throws he

45
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,299
needs to sniper he throws him down the

46
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,460
middle so he might look at that naked

47
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,619
though yeah

48
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:39,840
it's back dangerous that guy has a

49
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,460
warrior spirit

50
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,860
crazy Warrior Spirit like maybe too

51
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,500
crazy like maybe if he fought you know

52
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,840
try to be a little more Elusive and but

53
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,060
it's like that's how he gets the fans

54
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,460
too he just he's do or die and he does

55
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,079
it every [ __ ] time he fights man you

56
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:57,240
can guarantee if Michael Chandler's

57
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,220
fighting some [ __ ] chaos is gonna

58
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,799
happen his his run in the UFC since he's

59
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,500
gotten signed is probably the crazy the

60
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,759
[ __ ] craziest in terms of

61
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,979
entertainment holy [ __ ] every fight he's

62
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:10,259
in is do or die yeah all of them are

63
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,420
exciting so but if yeah Connor comes

64
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,640
back it's gonna be at 170. he's got to

65
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,200
be he's a [ __ ] Master but he's also

66
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,300
still shooting a movie isn't he

67
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,120
uh yeah that's gotta takes you cannot

68
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,700
show the movie in [ __ ] train full for

69
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,140
a fight you just can't do it you can't

70
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,940
do anything and train for a fight no you

71
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,680
can't it'd be like but I don't think

72
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,000
he's actually trying to train for a

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,440
fight now but they're just talking about

74
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,060
him potentially fighting yeah but

75
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,280
everybody needs to recognize if that's

76
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,379
the case then you're talking about six

77
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:39,780
months from now and maybe

78
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,519
if I mean who does he fight so

79
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,099
volkanovsky and uh Islam fight and Islam

80
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:50,280
beats volkanovsky what's next

81
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,780
it's a good question is it a rematch

82
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,360
with Oliveira what is it that would be

83
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,700
exciting Islam versus I mean Poirier I

84
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,860
don't know if people he's not 265 he's

85
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,560
joking around he's just joking around um

86
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,120
is it yeah Poirier versus Islam

87
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,379
someone's got to come and make some

88
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:07,459
[ __ ] noise I mean
