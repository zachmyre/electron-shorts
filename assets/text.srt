1
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:16,039
and okay you're very professional you

2
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:19,400
know people are like how do you live and

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,079
things like that they're taking money

4
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:22,759
from the Russians and of course the

5
00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:25,520
answer's no but I I do this for a living

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,560
like I speak I don't have a youtube

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,539
channel that where it's you know I'm Joe

8
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:31,670
Rogan but I give speeches at

9
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,350
universities and things like that I do a

10
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,360
lot of interviews and so we're recording

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,910
now and set up ooh is it possible that

12
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,739
you could do a YouTube channel

13
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:45,860
would that work yeah like I I mean if

14
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,239
you introduced me so like I get

15
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:49,190
followers yeah we could do that too I'm

16
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,559
all-in with that that could absolutely

17
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:53,239
happen do you want to do that is it

18
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:55,549
something you want to do no I mean this

19
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:58,729
is a big question so I I came on because

20
00:00:58,729 --> 00:01:01,489
I just written a book called permanent

21
00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:04,610
record which is the the story of my life

22
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,530
because that's what publishers make you

23
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,060
do and when you're writing your first

24
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,330
book but it's more than that because I

25
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,890
didn't just want to talk about me it's

26
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:13,820
actually about the changing of

27
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,680
Technology and the changing of

28
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,190
government in this sort of post 9/11 era

29
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,780
which you know our generation just sort

30
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,080
of happened to be growing up during and

31
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,700
I was at the CIA and the NSA and all

32
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,200
this stuff but the day that the book

33
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,360
came out the government hit me with a

34
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,550
lawsuit and they hit the publisher of

35
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,690
the books with a with a lawsuit because

36
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,040
they don't want to see books like this

37
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,050
get written they especially don't want

38
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:42,470
to see books like this get read and so

39
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,180
the big thing was you know we didn't

40
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,380
know where this was going we didn't know

41
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,360
what was gonna happen and my publisher

42
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,540
of course wanted me very badly to let

43
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,150
people know this book existed in case

44
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,470
the government leaned hard and harder

45
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,240
harder we didn't know where where that's

46
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,600
going

47
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,390
I mean the government is still pursuing

48
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,240
that case quite strongly they're more

49
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,490
focused on though the financial

50
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,110
censorship side of it basically taking

51
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,209
any money that I made from it kind of is

52
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:11,150
a warning to the others and getting a

53
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,250
legal judgment against the publishers

54
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,629
saying you know you can't pay this guy

55
00:02:14,629 --> 00:02:17,120
that kind of thing more so than taking

56
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,590
the book off the shelves but that's not

57
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,499
because they're okay with the book being

58
00:02:21,499 --> 00:02:22,760
on the shelves it's because thankfully

59
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,240
we've got the first of

60
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,970
and so they can't and that's a very rare

61
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,720
and good thing but anyway in the context

62
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,050
of that they were like well what about

63
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,720
Joe Rogan and you know I I had heard

64
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,170
about you at this point but you know the

65
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,910
only thing that I had really seen that I

66
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,940
really understood had familiarity with

67
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,110
was like you talking to Bernie Sanders

68
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,720
which by the way I very much appreciated

69
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,820
hearing them because a lot of people

70
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,430
don't give the guy time to talk yeah to

71
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,350
hear him in those sound bites you don't

72
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,640
really get an understanding of who he

73
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,100
actually is right and this is the other

74
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,360
thing like they're like well you know

75
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,180
you can go on all these you know major

76
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,400
Network shows and I I did a couple of

77
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,070
them I did like a morning show I did

78
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:12,720
Brian Williams but broadly the media the

79
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,760
the the sort of more corporatized media

80
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,910
as we might say is exactly what you just

81
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,800
described right they they want you to be

82
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,840
able to answer in like 8 15 seconds or

83
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,200
less and when we're talking about big

84
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,030
massive shifts in society we're talking

85
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,720
about power we're talking about

86
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,740
technology and how it controls and

87
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,110
influences us in the future

88
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,970
you you can't have a meaningful

89
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,730
conversation with them those constraints

90
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,900
and so it said these guys all want to

91
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,990
say repeat these long discredited sort

92
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,280
of criticisms and you know I'm sure

93
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,720
you'll you'll you'll ask the same thing

94
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,670
and that's ok they're there for

95
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,280
questions but it's like we can't have

96
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,900
the conversation if we can't have this

97
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,510
space to think right breathe and have

98
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,970
this sort of discussion so anyway they

99
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:57,810
mentioned you

100
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,790
and I was like Joe Rogan Joe Rogan Joe

101
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,520
Rogan where do I know this name from

102
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,240
before Bernie Sanders and I look back

103
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,000
through my Twitter mentions and the

104
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,180
funny thing is your fans have been

105
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,390
harassing me to death for like the last

106
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,180
year's wonderful people wonderful people

107
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,770
but like go on Joe Rogan go on Joe Rogan

108
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:22,590
and I remember like after I had just

109
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,180
made a Twitter account Neil deGrasse

110
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,890
Tyson actually I helped me get on

111
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,830
Twitter gave me that little initial

112
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,460
boost and they said Joe Rogan and so I

113
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,410
they like linked you and you know I I

114
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,950
mouse over your name cuz I use a desktop

115
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,650
for this because security reasons and it

116
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,900
pops up and I get your avatar man and

117
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,920
like I have to say your logo it's the

118
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,900
worst thing in the world for people who

119
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,700
are like trying to be like politically

120
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,020
serious and you know they're worried

121
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,220
about the National Security Adviser

122
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,290
condemning because like this bald guy

123
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,480
with this maniacal grin and like the

124
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,160
third eye on his forehead and I'm like

125
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,750
oh man that's show but it's actually

126
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,060
like you watch you know wouldn't when

127
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,320
you watch what you do is it's great

128
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,880
stuff man it's great but that first

129
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,110
impression like I this almost didn't

130
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:15,080
happen but everybody who has talked to

131
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,240
you you know everybody who watches your

132
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,860
show I think they get a very different

133
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,090
impression and then how you're paying it

134
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,860
and for me it's a wonderful thing

135
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,240
because nobody understands that better

136
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,770
than I do right like the government ran

137
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,610
a smear campaign against me endlessly

138
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,440
for six months when I came forward in

139
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,180
June of 2013 I know we got way off topic

140
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,250
here oh I'll get back to it fine

141
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,860
there's no such thing as off topic we

142
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,770
could do okay talk about whatever great

143
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,380
great okay so for those people first off

144
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,190
who have no idea who the hell I am

145
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,200
I'm the guy who was behind the

146
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,910
revelations of global mass surveillance

147
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:53,630
in 2013 I worked for the CIA I worked

148
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:56,150
for the NSA as a contractor at the NS a

149
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,670
staff officer the CIA I was undercover

150
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:02,480
working at embassies but and I talked

151
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,740
about the difference between this and a

152
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,720
book and contractor and government

153
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,610
official and how it's all sort of lost

154
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,730
its meaning but I saw something wrong

155
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,500
and I saw basically the government was

156
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,530
violating the law and what I believe to

157
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,030
be the Constitution of the United States

158
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,190
and more broadly human rights for

159
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,510
everyone in the United States and around

160
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,560
the world there were domestic

161
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,910
surveillance programs there were mass

162
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,410
surveillance programs that worked

163
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,080
internationally basically everything

164
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,970
that they could monitor led they were

165
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:32,030
monitoring and this is actually like

166
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,650
people go war isn't that obvious isn't

167
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:34,760
that what they're supposed to do and

168
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,740
this is weird but the answer actually is

169
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,380
no under the framework of our

170
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,610
Constitution the government is only

171
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,890
supposed to be monitoring people that it

172
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,520
has a individualized particularized

173
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,920
suspicion of wrongdoing for right this

174
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,510
is we think about this in the investing

175
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,760
if means right like all those TV shows

176
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,220
where they're like go and get a warrant

177
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,600
the reason they have to do that like we

178
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,860
fought a revolution over this you know a

179
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,950
couple hundred years back is the idea

180
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,080
that when we had you know Kings when we

181
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,210
had governments of absolute power they

182
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,250
could simply go in your home and go you

183
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,840
know is this guy pot smoker get his

184
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,880
diary you know whatever it is and just

185
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,800
like if you find evidence of a crime you

186
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,060
March them off to prison and it's all

187
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,220
good you found evidence they're criminal

188
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,810
or you didn't find evidence well no harm

189
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:21,530
no foul

190
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,790
you're just doing what government does

191
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:28,100
we were trying to build a better system

192
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,190
where when yes the government has

193
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,990
extraordinary capabilities but it only

194
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,030
uses them whether they're necessary

195
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:38,900
right where they're proportionate to the

196
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,640
threat that is presented by this person

197
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,620
you know like we shouldn't be afraid of

198
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,030
the person who's got like a baggie of

199
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,240
weed in their dresser or something like

200
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,500
that that is not a threat to national

201
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,970
security that's not a threat to public

202
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:54,350
safety but what happened in the wake of

203
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,300
9/11 was a whole bunch of government

204
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,070
officials got together behind closed

205
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,780
doors and this was actually led

206
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,670
interestingly enough by the Vice

207
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,340
President of the United States Cheney

208
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,420
everybody remembers that name or

209
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:09,050
hopefully I can look that name up Dick

210
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:12,860
Cheney and his personal attorney sort of

211
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,150
the the Giuliani of Dick Cheney a guy

212
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,200
named David Addington

213
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,860
and this lawyer David Addington wrote a

214
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,430
secret legal interpretation but no one

215
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,620
else was allowed to see it was kept in

216
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,940
the vice president's safe at the White

217
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,640
House they weren't giving this even when

218
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,500
they told people and it was just a

219
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,130
couple people in Congress Nancy Pelosi

220
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,300
was one of them on a couple of these

221
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,840
other folks when they talked to the

222
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,090
heads of the agency the NSA and the CIA

223
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,270
and the FBI and all this stuff they told

224
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,040
them the White House in the office of

225
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,320
legal counsel and you know this this the

226
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,330
president's attorneys all of these guys

227
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,500
had decided this would be legal to do

228
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,080
but we can't tell you why we can't show

229
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,670
you the legal authorization where you

230
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,350
just got to take our word for it

231
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,250
and so they

232
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,480
did this and this became a mass

233
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,340
surveillance program called stellar wind

234
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,530
which they said was supposed to monitor

235
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,600
the phone calls in Internet

236
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,090
communications emails and things like

237
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,380
that of everybody in the United States

238
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,940
and around the world who they could get

239
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,720
access to for links al Qaeda because if

240
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,000
you remember in the wake of the

241
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,400
September 11th attacks they were singing

242
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,500
we thought there could be sleeper cells

243
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,150
about Qaeda that we've just you know

244
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,500
peppered all throughout the country they

245
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,670
were gonna spring up at any moment of

246
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,500
course like weapons of mass destruction

247
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,150
it just didn't exist it was all the

248
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,650
power grab

249
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:42,260
but on that basis they started doing

250
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,850
this in secret and it was completely

251
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,500
unconstitutional was completely illegal

252
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,570
even under the very loose requirements

253
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:50,900
of the Patriot Act but they did it for

254
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,050
so long that they got comfortable with

255
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,160
it and they thought this is it you know

256
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,960
this is a really powerful capability

257
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,250
what have we started using this for

258
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,080
stuff that was other than terrorism

259
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,180
because it wasn't finding any terrorists

260
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,910
because there weren't any terrorists in

261
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,800
this context that we're looking for them

262
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,140
and the ones who we're there were

263
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,700
terrorists the program wasn't affected

264
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,110
because these were guys in Pakistan that

265
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,870
weren't using you know email and phone

266
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,670
calls they were getting on you know

267
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,170
moped with their cousin who was a

268
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:20,420
courier who was bringing a letter to his

269
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,000
guy you know who runs the the food stand

270
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,290
or whatever but bit by bit over time

271
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,820
this grew and grew and grew and there

272
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,290
were scandals and if you want to drill

273
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,820
down in these later all going to him but

274
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:36,680
what happened was step by step by step

275
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,339
our constitutional rights were changed

276
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:42,440
and we weren't allowed to know it we

277
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,570
were never granted a vote on it and even

278
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:47,150
the many members of Congress right 535

279
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,550
in the United States they were

280
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:53,089
prohibited from knowing this and instead

281
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:56,089
they told only a few select people yeah

282
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:57,200
in the original case there were only

283
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,060
eight members of Congress called the

284
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,360
gang of eight who knew about this then

285
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,220
there were the people on the

286
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,680
intelligence committees both in the

287
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,030
Senate in the house who were told about

288
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,400
this but they were only told partially

289
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,420
about it they weren't told the full

290
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,820
scope of it and now that they had been

291
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,530
told about it because they had security

292
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:16,279
clearances and

293
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:17,360
like that they weren't allowed to tell

294
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,639
anybody else even if they objected to it

295
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:23,360
and we had one Senator Ron Wyden I mean

296
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,680
another one I believe Tom Udall was

297
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,569
named of him who did object to this and

298
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:28,040
who wanted something to happen but

299
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,569
because they couldn't tell anybody that

300
00:11:29,569 --> 00:11:30,889
was happening they were sort of doing

301
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:33,949
these weird lassie barks to the press

302
00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:35,149
where they were like we have grave

303
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:36,649
concerns about the way these programs

304
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:38,809
are being carried out but nobody knew

305
00:11:38,809 --> 00:11:40,819
what they were talking about and so

306
00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:42,259
journalists were like you know they've

307
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:43,730
got concerns what is that Lassie what

308
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:44,930
are you trying to say timmy's them well

309
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,550
but they were getting it wrong they

310
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,139
couldn't tell what was happening so what

311
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:50,990
had happened was that we the American

312
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:53,809
people had sort of lost our seat at the

313
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:55,999
table of government we were no longer

314
00:11:55,999 --> 00:11:57,680
partner to government we had simply

315
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,029
become subject to government and I think

316
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:03,110
everybody who's in the world today who

317
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,149
is aware of what's going on whether it's

318
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:07,160
under this administration last

319
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,110
administration the one before that right

320
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:13,610
they have seen a constant kind of shift

321
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:17,149
where we have we the public have less

322
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:19,430
say and less influence over the policy

323
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:22,250
of government with each passing year

324
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,129
there's kind of a new class that's being

325
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:27,379
created a government class and then the

326
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:30,259
public civil class that are held to

327
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:31,879
different standards of behavior and when

328
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:32,990
we start talking about leaking and

329
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,699
whistleblowing this becomes even more

330
00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:38,629
clear and so what I did was I wanted to

331
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:40,939
clarify that kind of lassie bark right I

332
00:12:40,939 --> 00:12:43,040
just wanted everybody to know what was

333
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,279
going on I didn't want to say the

334
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:48,410
government can't do this I didn't want

335
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,329
to say this is how you guys have to live

336
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:52,639
because that's not for me to say now but

337
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,050
I do believe that everybody in the

338
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,879
United States and more broadly people in

339
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:56,809
the world who are having their rights

340
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,720
violated by a government should have at

341
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,610
least an understanding of how that is

342
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,040
happening what the authorities sort of

343
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,389
the policies and programs that are

344
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:08,329
enabling that or so that they can

345
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,879
protest them so that they can cast a

346
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:12,800
vote about them so that they can't say

347
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,899
you know what you guys say this is okay

348
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:17,480
but I disagreed that this is not okay I

349
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,670
object and I want things to change and

350
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,379
so I gathered evidence of what I believe

351
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:24,019
to be a criminal or unconstitutional

352
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:26,569
activity on the part of government and I

353
00:13:26,569 --> 00:13:29,330
gave this to journalists right

354
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:32,120
now I gave this to journalists under a

355
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,649
very strict condition here which was

356
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:36,080
that they publish no story in this

357
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,540
archive of information simply because it

358
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,279
was interesting right no clickbait not

359
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,709
anything just because they thought it

360
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:44,290
would make news that we get them awards

361
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,760
they would only publish stories that

362
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,620
they were willing to make an

363
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,600
institutional judgment and stand behind

364
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,959
and this was three different newspapers

365
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,970
that it was in the public interest to

366
00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:00,470
know and so then beyond that there was

367
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,089
additional is because if you could see

368
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:03,890
sort of what I was doing here what had

369
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,709
happened what had led us into this

370
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:12,320
pitfall was that the system of checks

371
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,000
and balances that's supposed to

372
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,890
self-regulate our government had failed

373
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:19,160
the courts had abdicated their role in

374
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,959
policing the executive in the Congress

375
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,050
because terrorism was such a hot

376
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,940
argument at the time they were worried

377
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,829
about being criticized and blamed if

378
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:29,240
something went wrong an attack did go

379
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,459
through and they didn't have access to

380
00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:33,230
the information that the programs were

381
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,700
ineffective so they were just taking the

382
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,320
government's word for it they didn't

383
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,230
want to wait in Congress most of them

384
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,170
didn't even know right and the ones who

385
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:44,420
did know it was the same thing they were

386
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,370
getting their pockets stuffed with money

387
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,589
by the defense contractors that were

388
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:50,270
getting rich for building these systems

389
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,800
that were violating the rights of each

390
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,470
of us so they benefited by just saying

391
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,550
nothing and then the executive

392
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,709
themselves whether we're talking about

393
00:14:57,709 --> 00:14:59,240
Bush right whether we're talking about

394
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,560
Obama or whether we're talking about

395
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,529
Trump now all these guys were okay with

396
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:05,300
a constantly growing surveillance state

397
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,220
because they're the ones whose hands

398
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,110
were on the lever at the time they got

399
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,899
to aim it they got to use it if you had

400
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:14,029
a little search box in front of you they

401
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:16,279
would give you the email history and you

402
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:17,779
know of everybody in the United States

403
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:19,190
anybody you want if you could pull up

404
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,320
their text messages anybody you want if

405
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,370
you could see anything they've ever

406
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,260
typed into that Google search box right

407
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,750
Joe what is the worst thing you've ever

408
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,750
typed into that search box that lasts

409
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,290
forever

410
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,000
right and they have a record of that

411
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,970
they can get that from Google and so

412
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,339
this was this was the whole thing how do

413
00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:40,970
we correct for that so when you have

414
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,339
somebody

415
00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:43,779
who wants to inform the public of

416
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:45,519
something and we'll get into the proper

417
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,689
channels arguments later but you can't

418
00:15:49,689 --> 00:15:51,639
go through the institution to get these

419
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:53,889
corrected because the institution knows

420
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:56,139
it's wrong and is doing it anyway right

421
00:15:56,139 --> 00:15:58,600
that's the whole origin of the program

422
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,339
is they want to do something that

423
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:03,519
they're not allowed to do what do you do

424
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,499
right and so I didn't want to say I'm

425
00:16:05,499 --> 00:16:06,910
the president of Secrets I didn't want

426
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,870
to just put this stuff on the internet

427
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,699
and I could have on the technologist

428
00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:12,939
right I worked with the journalists and

429
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:15,579
then that to create an adversarial step

430
00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:18,040
right someone who would argue against

431
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,110
what I believed and hopefully what the

432
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,059
journalists believe once they consulted

433
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:23,889
the documents and basically

434
00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:28,480
authenticated them can we get the

435
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,259
government to play that role right and

436
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:34,300
so before the journalists published any

437
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,160
story this is a controversial thing

438
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,809
people still criticize me for this

439
00:16:37,809 --> 00:16:38,769
actually they say I was too

440
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:40,029
accommodating government think they

441
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:43,870
could be right is that the journalist

442
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,160
would go to the government and give them

443
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,899
warning say we're about to run this

444
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:48,999
story about this secret program that

445
00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:52,990
says you did X Y & Z bad thing one is

446
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,850
that right and the government always go

447
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,759
over no comment right - is this gonna

448
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,949
cause harm is anybody gonna get hurt is

449
00:16:59,949 --> 00:17:01,389
this program effective is there

450
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:03,459
something we don't understand right as

451
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:05,649
if something Snowden doesn't understand

452
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,750
it is this guy just not get it right are

453
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,640
these documents fake whatever you want

454
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,270
say we shouldn't run this story in every

455
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,770
case I'm aware of that process was

456
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,929
followed and that's why right it was

457
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:17,799
because there's a lot of people out

458
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:19,659
there who don't like me who criticize me

459
00:17:19,659 --> 00:17:21,610
who go this was unsafe this caused harm

460
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:24,909
to people or whatever we're in 2019

461
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:28,600
now I came forward and these stories

462
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,010
weren't the Pulitzer Prize for public

463
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,529
service journalism starting way back in

464
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:38,440
June of 2013 we've had six years to show

465
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,690
bodies we've had six years to show harm

466
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,000
and you know as well as I do the

467
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,320
government's happy to leak things when

468
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,380
it's in in their interest nobody has

469
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,640
been hurt as a result of these

470
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,770
disclosures because everyone who was

471
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,110
involved in them was so careful we

472
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,220
wanted to maximize

473
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,320
the public benefit while mitigating the

474
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,380
potential risks and I think we did a

475
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,030
pretty good job but just to get back to

476
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,460
the the main thing and the original

477
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,280
thing that got us off on that trail

478
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,070
when I came forward in June of 2013 and

479
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,750
I gave one interview to the people who

480
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:14,140
were in the room with the documents

481
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,750
Laura Poitras Glenn Greenwald you and

482
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,630
McCaskill and I said who I was I said

483
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:20,980
why I was doing this I said what this

484
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,650
was about why it matters and that we

485
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,030
were constructing a system of turnkey

486
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,280
tyranny and even if you trust that to

487
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,990
Obama you never know whose hand is gonna

488
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,000
be on that key next and all I have to do

489
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,860
is turn it and there's nothing we can do

490
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,049
to stop it the only thing that's

491
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:36,820
restraining these programs really is is

492
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,669
policy more so than the law and the

493
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:41,350
President and anytime can sign a napkin

494
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:45,970
and those policies change well after

495
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:48,400
that I went six months without giving

496
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,590
any interviews because I didn't want

497
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,789
people to talk about me and I wanted

498
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:53,110
them to talk about what actually

499
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,250
mattered and the government of course

500
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,870
was trying very hard to change the

501
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:58,419
conversation as they always do to be

502
00:18:58,419 --> 00:18:59,950
about who is this guy what have they

503
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,480
done right what's wrong with them what

504
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,830
are their problems who is this this

505
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,740
loony guy so they can controversial eyes

506
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,650
the source of a story rather than having

507
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:12,850
to confront that the story itself and

508
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,429
that's why I said it's I I really kind

509
00:19:15,429 --> 00:19:21,880
of appreciate your your take on the

510
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,240
media and everything like that because

511
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,679
when you don't tell your story you know

512
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:28,419
other people will tell it for you

513
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:30,159
they'll say so many things about you and

514
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:32,110
they'll have these misimpressions like I

515
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,730
did because if something is stupid as

516
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,500
the avatar that you were using on

517
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,690
Twitter right well I think it's a

518
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,190
certain kind of show with a certain kind

519
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,380
of guy and it's this crazy stuff but

520
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,720
when I actually listen to you when I

521
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,090
actually look at the facts right and

522
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,120
when I hear you just speak I go actually

523
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,250
this is a thoughtful guy actually this

524
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,990
is somebody who does care who does want

525
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,850
to look at these things deeply and

526
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:56,950
appearances and our first impressions

527
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:00,100
can be very misleading I work hard on

528
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,210
that I try to mislead people it's good

529
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,649
works to my advantage do a good job man

530
00:20:05,649 --> 00:20:07,050
thank you

531
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:08,760
I want to bring it back to when you

532
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,430
first started with the NSA you started

533
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:14,190
as a contractor right what was your

534
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,620
initial impression and when did you know

535
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:20,280
that things were really squirrely with

536
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,130
the programs that sort of thing so I'm

537
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,870
not saying this to put put you on the

538
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,160
spot I know you've been a busy guy I

539
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,000
don't know you hadn't done I think shows

540
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,880
recently you come back from break right

541
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,830

549
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,190
weird history in the intelligence

550
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:56,600
community I grew up in a federal family

551
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,340
in the shadow of Fort Meade right all

552
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,930
these little suburban communities in

553
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,880
Maryland where basically the entire

554
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,040
industry of the state is the federal

555
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,450
government of all these different

556
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,580
agencies and then all the subcontractors

557
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,860
all the defense industries that serve

558
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,780
that government and really are kind of

559
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,940
our war making a machine are our system

560
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,940
of control for the country and the world

561
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,840
broadly all that stuff spreads and you

562
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,670
know a couple hundred mile radius out of

563
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:28,860
DC my mother worked for the district

564
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,920
courts rather than federal courts and

565
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,900
it's kind of funny because she still

566
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,130
works there and those are the courts

567
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,300
that are trying to throw me in jail for

568
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,090
the rest of my life now my father worked

569
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,490
for the Coast Guard retired after 30

570
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,200
years my grandfather was an admiral and

571
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,730
then he worked for the FBI as far back

572
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:51,270
as it goes my my family my whole line of

573
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:54,750
family even generations back was working

574
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,360
for the government um so it was pretty

575
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,630
ordinary pretty expected for me to go

576
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:03,270
into the same kind of work now I started

577
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:07,490
and I wasn't super successful in school

578
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:13,110
because it I felt and you know this is

579
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,130
the most arrogant thing in the world

580
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:16,850
than anybody says

581
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:23,280
that I had more to learn from computers

582
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,140
than I did from you know biology class

583
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,040
and so I spent more and more time

584
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,840
focusing on technology then I got mono

585
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:35,160
and I dropped out of high school and now

586
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,490
it's like alright how do I make this up

587
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:41,370
I drop out of high school but I'm

588
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:42,660
actually going to Community College

589
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,820
right they called it concurrent

590
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,930
enrollment where I'm not taking any

591
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,180
classes at high school I'm going to

592
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,510
Community College instead and I'm not

593
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,250
doing that great they're either like

594
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,300
it's fine

595
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,430
you know I'm enjoying it but you know

596
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,670
school is school I I want I can't wait

597
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:04,680
to be grown you're aboard um and I think

598
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:08,520
a lot of people have felt that but I ran

599
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,110
into somebody at the Community College

600
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,690
who ran their own home-based business

601
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,580
doing web design and they could see I

602
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,620
was kind of technical and they went hey

603
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,970
do you want to work for me and I was

604
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:20,940
like the woman that sounds great and so

605
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,920
I started doing web design really really

606
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,830
early on this is like gosh I don't know

607
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:31,290
probably a 1998 vintage during the big

608
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:33,330
boom and then the collapse that followed

609
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,800
and the funny thing is she worked she

610
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:41,010
was married to an NSA analyst a linguist

611
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:44,610
right and so she lived on Fort Meade and

612
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:48,270
she ran her business out of their home

613
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:50,400
on Fort Meade that's right up the street

614
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,830
from the NSA so before I'm even working

615
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:55,890
there I'm driving past this building all

616
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:58,770
of the time and trying to figure out you

617
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,420
know what the next step is gonna be and

618
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,610
I enjoy this it's it's a good thing for

619
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:05,570
me and it like it works well and I start

620
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:08,190
getting trained and certified all these

621
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,080
little industry stamps you've got to get

622
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,850
as a technologist to say oh you know

623
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,100
this program or whatever and just start

624
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,310
climbing the ladder but then 9/11

625
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:21,870
happens and I'm on Fort Meade when 9/11

626
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,430
happens I'm just going into work and I

627
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:27,780
tell this in the book in some detail and

628
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,030
I think it's very much worth reading

629
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,590
four people don't know this because this

630
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,300
forgotten history but how old were you

631
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:37,230
at this money uh uh OSH I was I was born

632
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:43,910
at 83 so I was probably 18 years old and

633
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:48,540
yeah yeah I just turned 18 a couple

634
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:56,090
months before and what people forget is

635
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:58,050
who knew what was going on before

636
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:01,710
anybody else Wow on September 11th the

637
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:05,880
intelligence community right and what

638
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,610
did they do right did they give out a

639
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:10,230
public warning did they tell you guys to

640
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:11,640
evacuate did they say do this adder

641
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,390
doesn't know no not for everybody not

642
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:22,350
for a long time but at the NSA then

643
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:25,500
director Michael Hayden he was a general

644
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,160
he later became a director of the CIA

645
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:32,030
ordered the entire campus evacuated of

646
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,220
thousands tens of thousands of people

647
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:37,440
actually just said go home right

648
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,720
the CIA did the same thing they were

649
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,080
running on skeleton crews at the moment

650
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,150
the country needed them more than they

651
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:52,200
ever had right and I get a call well not

652
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,030
hear a call that's from my boss's wife

653
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:59,310
her husband to her he's calling from the

654
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,810
NSA he's saying hey you know I think

655
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:02,700
edge leave for the day because I'm the

656
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,110
only employee of this business besides

657
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:06,390
her because I think they're gonna close

658
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,800
the base down and I'm like this is crazy

659
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,630
they've never closed us down we don't

660
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:10,590
know what's happening then we start

661
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:13,380
checking the news which is through

662
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,360
websites right because we're we're doing

663
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,280
all this stuff and suddenly it's the big

664
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,370
story everywhere and you know nobody

665
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:23,970
understands how big it is yet most of us

666
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:25,320
are like oh it's gonna mess with our

667
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,580
workday oh it's gonna mess with our

668
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:31,050
commute but when I'm leaving I hear car

669
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,490
horns all over the base it's the

670
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:33,570
craziest thing because this is a

671
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:34,830
military base right it's right outside

672
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:37,410
the NSA and I entered just this absolute

673
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:39,840
state of pandemonium as I go past k9

674
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,550
road which is the road that travels

675
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,580
right and Pat it

676
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:46,510
in front of the NSA's headquarters and

677
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:49,300
it's just a parking lot as far as you

678
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,940
can see they have military police out

679
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:55,080
under the stoplights directing traffic

680
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,340
because this is this mass evacuation and

681
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,960
I still have no idea what's happening

682
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,580
like the the story is still developing

683
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:11,710
but I will never forget that image why

684
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,480
did these people have so much power and

685
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,030
so much money and so much authority that

686
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:18,400
if at the moments we need them the most

687
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,800
there are the first ones in the country

688
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,730
that are leaving their buildings and you

689
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:28,360
know later on they said and this is uh

690
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:33,400
covered in a book I believe I think it's

691
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,970
James Bamford who interviewed that

692
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:38,730
director of NSA who gave that order

693
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:40,690
about what was happening he was going

694
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:43,840
well you know he called his wife and he

695
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,430
was asking where their kids were and

696
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,860
everything like that and then after that

697
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:50,830
he wanted to think about well where

698
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,810
could these other planes that they knew

699
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:54,100
were in the air that it hadn't struck

700
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,040
yet where could they be headed and this

701
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,910
sort of shows how self centric the

702
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:04,240
intelligence community is this is the DC

703
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,220
metro area right they get hit the white

704
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,890
house they get hit Congress they get hit

705
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,220
the Supreme Court right I think oh

706
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,750
they're gonna fly their planes into the

707
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,250
CIA headquarters oh they're gonna fly

708
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,010
their planes into the NSA headquarters

709
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:19,660
and of course it was never realistic

710
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:22,960
that these would be the targets but on

711
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,970
that basis they were like oh let's get

712
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,880
our bacon out of the pan but why say

713
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,730
this I'm sorry but just in the interest

714
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:33,730
of what wasn't it possible that they

715
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,140
could have attacked those places I mean

716
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,600
they attacked the Pentagon they you know

717
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,640
they knew that there was attacked look

718
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,310
it's it's absolutely possible they could

719
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:44,110
have attacked your Denny's right you

720
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:47,200
know but it's a question of risk

721
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,690
assessment if you have planes in the air

722
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:54,220
if you believe there's an ongoing

723
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,780
terrorist attack that's happening in the

724
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,520
United States

725
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,650
right now and if you have built

726
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:03,809
history's greatest surveillance agencies

727
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:06,050
right that the most powerful

728
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:08,760
intelligence forces in the history of

729
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,030
the species you are gonna take those off

730
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,860
the board or at least the majority of

731
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,530
their personnel off the board then in a

732
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:19,320
chance that you have no sort of grounds

733
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,850
for substantiating that they could be

734
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:23,070
targeting you to begin with simply

735
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:25,530
because they could well somebody else

736
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:28,590
will get hit with those as you say it's

737
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,480
gonna be the Pentagon right it's gonna

738
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,910
be the World Trade Center it's gonna be

739
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:35,880
someone somewhere and the more minutes

740
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,650
you're in front of that desk the higher

741
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,390
the chances even if it's a very small

742
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:41,100
chance even if it's somebody who doesn't

743
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,870
work on terrorism right maybe if it's

744
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:45,870
somebody who normally works finance in

745
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:48,300
North Korea right but they go look this

746
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,590
is an emergency everybody understands

747
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,940
you don't need to explain this you just

748
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:54,059
go stop what you're doing look at

749
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,100
financial transactions related to who

750
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,570
purchased these plane tickets and do

751
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:59,550
this you just go full spectrum and go

752
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,679
anything you can do right now if the

753
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,300
building gets hit we get hit that's what

754
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,390
we signed up for nobody wants that right

755
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:09,679
that that's not the desired outcome but

756
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,010
if they had asked the staff to do then

757
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:16,140
they all would have agreed that's what

758
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,240
these people signed up to do and yet the

759
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,830
director goes no you know we're just

760
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:22,380
just know like we're not gonna take that

761
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:25,380
writ and this is I think it says so much

762
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:29,610
about the bureaucratic character of how

763
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,830
government works right the people who

764
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,900
rise to the top of these governments

765
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,940
it's about risk management for them

766
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,010
right it's about never being criticized

767
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,690
for something and this is look if we

768
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:44,280
want to get really controversial this is

769
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,080
something that'll that'll haunt me

770
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,600
because people will bring it up again

771
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,360
and again and again people ask about you

772
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,179
know people still criticize me in the

773
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:55,740
book you know I talk about aliens and

774
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,940
chemtrails and things like that effect

775
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,580
there there's no evidence for that I

776
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,580
went looking on the network right and

777
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,740
III know Joey

778
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:08,730
I know you want there to be aliens a

779
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:11,399
doob I know Neil deGrasse Tyson badly

780
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:14,070
once there to be aliens and there

781
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,529
probably are right but the idea that

782
00:31:16,529 --> 00:31:19,590
that we're hiding them if we are hiding

783
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,509
them I had ridiculous access to the

784
00:31:21,509 --> 00:31:23,580
networks at the NSA the CIA the military

785
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:26,460
all these groups I couldn't find

786
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,350
anything right so if it's hidden and it

787
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,690
could be hidden it's hidden really damn

788
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,610
well even for people who are on the

789
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:35,970
inside but the main thing is conspiracy

790
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,590
theories right everybody wants to

791
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,149
believe in conspiracy theories because

792
00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:42,570
it helps life make sense it helps us

793
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:45,090
believe that somebody has control in

794
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:46,980
control right that somebody is calling

795
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,230
the shots that these things all happen

796
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:52,679
for a reason to stand the other there

797
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:56,429
are real conspiracies but they're not

798
00:31:56,429 --> 00:31:59,039
typically you know they've got tens of

799
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,539
thousands of people working on them

800
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:01,470
unless you're talking about the

801
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:02,549
existence of the intelligence community

802
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:06,029
itself which is basically constructed on

803
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:08,639
the idea that you can get I I think

804
00:32:08,639 --> 00:32:11,429
there's a four million or 1.4 million

805
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,379
people in the United States who hold

806
00:32:13,379 --> 00:32:16,619
security clearances and you can get all

807
00:32:16,619 --> 00:32:18,840
of these people to not talk ever the

808
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,019
journalists in this that or the other

809
00:32:21,019 --> 00:32:24,990
but when you look back at the 9/11

810
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,490
report and when you look back at the

811
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:28,019
history of what actually happened what

812
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:29,789
we can prove right not what we can

813
00:32:29,789 --> 00:32:31,049
speculate on but what are at least two

814
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:37,470
commonly agreed facts not it's very

815
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:40,529
clear to me as someone who worked in the

816
00:32:40,529 --> 00:32:42,240
intelligence community not during this

817
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,860
period of course I was too young but

818
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:47,940
very shortly thereafter that these

819
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,100
attacks could have been prevented and in

820
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,799
fact the government says this too but

821
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,509
the government goes the the reason that

822
00:32:54,509 --> 00:32:56,369
they these attacks happen the reason

823
00:32:56,369 --> 00:32:59,879
that they weren't prevented is what they

824
00:32:59,879 --> 00:33:01,889
call stovepiping right there was there

825
00:33:01,889 --> 00:33:04,019
was not enough sharing they needed to

826
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:06,240
break down the walls and the

827
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,919
restrictions that were chaining these

828
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,309
poor Patriots at the NSA and the CIA and

829
00:33:11,309 --> 00:33:12,509
the FBI from all working on the same

830
00:33:12,509 --> 00:33:15,059
team and to some extent they're they're

831
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:17,100
correct on this right there there were

832
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:17,779
limits on

833
00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:19,489
Way agencies were supposed to play ball

834
00:33:19,489 --> 00:33:22,580
with each other but I worked there and I

835
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,779
know how much of this is and

836
00:33:23,779 --> 00:33:28,119
how much as this is not those are

837
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:30,320
procedural and policy limits in some

838
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,320
cases legal limits on what can be shared

839
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,820
without following process without doing

840
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,159
this that or the other without basically

841
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:39,109
asking for permission without getting a

842
00:33:39,109 --> 00:33:41,259
sign-off or anything like that

843
00:33:41,259 --> 00:33:43,879
if the FBI wanted to send absolutely

844
00:33:43,879 --> 00:33:45,889
everything they had to the CIA they

845
00:33:45,889 --> 00:33:47,659
could have done so if the CIA wanted to

846
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:49,369
send everything they had to the FBI they

847
00:33:49,369 --> 00:33:51,979
could have done so they didn't and

848
00:33:51,979 --> 00:33:54,349
people died as a result now government

849
00:33:54,349 --> 00:33:56,869
goes bureaucratic procedural ISM was

850
00:33:56,869 --> 00:33:59,210
responsible and it's because we had too

851
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,679
many restrictions on the intelligence

852
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:01,909
community and this is what led to the

853
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:03,799
world post 9/11 where all of our rights

854
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:05,809
sort of evaporated was they went well

855
00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:07,549
restrictions on what these agencies can

856
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:11,299
do are costing lives therefore naturally

857
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,069
we just have to unchain these guys and

858
00:34:13,069 --> 00:34:15,799
everything will be better right and if

859
00:34:15,799 --> 00:34:19,069
you remember that post 9/11 moment you

860
00:34:19,069 --> 00:34:20,480
can understand how that actually could

861
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,849
come off as persuasive how that might be

862
00:34:22,849 --> 00:34:24,289
a kind of thing to go you go all right

863
00:34:24,289 --> 00:34:26,149
well will that make sense because

864
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:29,899
everybody was terrified right there were

865
00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:31,879
people quite quickly who got their heads

866
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:33,289
back on their shoulders the right way

867
00:34:33,289 --> 00:34:35,210
there were some of them who never lost

868
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:38,450
their heads at all and who protested the

869
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:39,079
Iraq war

870
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:41,000
at the same time lion-o himself was

871
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,730
signing up to go fight it volunteering

872
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:45,079
for the army and we're getting into that

873
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:52,399
a minute but everything that has

874
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,909
followed in the decades past came from

875
00:34:55,909 --> 00:35:00,049
the fact that in a moment of fear we

876
00:35:00,049 --> 00:35:03,049
lost our heads and we abandoned all the

877
00:35:03,049 --> 00:35:05,390
traditional constitutional restraints

878
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,369
that we put on these agencies and we

879
00:35:07,369 --> 00:35:10,029
abandon all of the traditional political

880
00:35:10,029 --> 00:35:12,079
restraints and just social constraints

881
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:17,390
ideological systems of belief about the

882
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:19,250
limitations that the secret police

883
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,640
should have in a free and open society

884
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:25,579
and we went look you know terrorists we

885
00:35:25,579 --> 00:35:27,710
created shows like 24 and Jack Bauer

886
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,150
where he's like threatening knife

887
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,619
people's eyeballs out if they won't tell

888
00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:31,210
him this that

889
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:36,250
the other and we entered this era of

890
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,260
increasingly unlimited government as a

891
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:41,170
result and now in hindsight we go we

892
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:43,750
should have been surprised but at the

893
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,849
time everyone everyone panicked trying

894
00:35:45,849 --> 00:35:48,430
but if you go back to you did that help

895
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:51,220
and we know the answer now is in fact no

896
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:51,760
it did not

897
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,480
it made things worse I don't think any

898
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,950
historian is gonna look at the Bush

899
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:59,140
administration and go this improved the

900
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,339
position of the United States in the

901
00:36:00,339 --> 00:36:05,980
world but if you go back you don't wind

902
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,010
back the tape to that pre 9/11 moment

903
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:10,599
lying back the tape to those silos and

904
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:11,920
those walls that they said needed to

905
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,180
come down because that was restraining

906
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,830
government instead of the rules that

907
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:16,480
said we can't share these things but

908
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,950
there's got to be a basis there's got to

909
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,810
be a justification you've got to go why

910
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,369
are we trading people's information like

911
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:23,040
baseball cards and all of this stuff

912
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,980
it's super easy as an intelligence

913
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:29,410
officer to justify sharing information

914
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:32,170
about a suspected terrorist who you

915
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:34,359
think is planning to kill people or is

916
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,099
even just in a country they shouldn't be

917
00:36:36,099 --> 00:36:37,599
or a place they shouldn't be or doing

918
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,220
something you don't think they should be

919
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:42,040
with another agency because no one's

920
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,330
gonna question that a judge isn't gonna

921
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:44,380
question that any judge in the world

922
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,060
will stamp that warrant without even

923
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,290
thinking about it and go to bed that

924
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:50,680
night you know without a care in the

925
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,109
world because you're not spying on a

926
00:36:53,109 --> 00:36:54,280
journalist you know spying on a human

927
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,599
rights defender right this is not an

928
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,820
edge case now this is someone that you

929
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,290
believe to be associated with al-qaeda

930
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:03,339
or whatever now this is all a lot of

931
00:37:03,339 --> 00:37:06,000
preamble to say that essential fact

932
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,710
government agrees everyone agrees the

933
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,000
attacks probably could have been

934
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,780
prevented if information had been shared

935
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:16,060
so why wasn't the information shared

936
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:19,180
government says information wasn't

937
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,670
shared because of these restrictions and

938
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:24,010
it's half true because every important

939
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:26,170
lie has has some criminal truth to it

940
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:28,570
and and there were these barriers but

941
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:30,250
the reality is why were those barriers

942
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,859
respected in the case of a major

943
00:37:32,859 --> 00:37:36,190
terrorist plot why wasn't the CIA

944
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:38,170
sharing information with the FBI why

945
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:39,490
wasn't the FBI sharing information with

946
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:41,020
the NSA why was the Anastacia sharing

947
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,490
information with the CIA in the case of

948
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:44,620
Mary major terrorists

949
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:47,240
and if you've worked in government if

950
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,410
you've worked in the intelligence

951
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:49,910
community if you worked in any large

952
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:51,530
institution you know if you work at a

953
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:54,680
company that sells batteries you know

954
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,230
that every office is fighting the other

955
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:00,620
office for budget for cloud for

956
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,420
promotions and this is the sad reality

957
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:06,590
of what actually happened every one of

958
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,810
those agencies wanted to be the guy who

959
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:11,090
busted the plot they wanted to be the

960
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:13,130
one who got credit for it and they

961
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:15,590
didn't realize how serious it was until

962
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:18,260
it was too late because they were

963
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,210
competing with each other rather than

964
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:22,370
cooperating that's exactly what I was

965
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:24,620
gonna ask you if that was the issue the

966
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,360
competition between these agencies

967
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,830
because they are very proud of the CIA

968
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:31,640
accomplishing something with the FBI

969
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,230
accomplishing something and they they

970
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:35,480
want to be the one to take credit for

971
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,760
that yeah and I mean I think it's

972
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,920
important like in their defense because

973
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,380
nobody else here is gonna provide a

974
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:46,420
defense for them is that that's actually

975
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:50,690
darkly human again this happens in every

976
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:52,640
industry this happens in every sort of

977
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,350
big corporate thing because you want to

978
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:56,270
get promoted and you know everybody's

979
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:57,950
putting in their like achievements at

980
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,840
the end of the year for what they did if

981
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,980
you're the guy who does that you're

982
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,750
going straight to the top but their

983
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:05,810
solutions status was the the so we we

984
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,400
have a weird delay here for folks that

985
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,260
are listening claim their solution

986
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,690
instead of having someone be responsible

987
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:13,310
for bridging the gap and providing that

988
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,110
information to each individual agency

989
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:18,640
their solution was mass surveillance

990
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,320
well no they're they're different things

991
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,530
this is 9/11 is what woke these guys up

992
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:28,820
ROM basically and they went well we

993
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:31,160
screwed up and Americans died as a

994
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:35,000
result we really don't want to take the

995
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,070
hit on that and to be honest the

996
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,390
government had no interest in putting

997
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:40,820
the hit on them to be honest the public

998
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,500
had no interest in putting the hit on

999
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,220
them at the time because everybody

1000
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,410
understood terrorism is a real thing

1001
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:50,540
there are bad people in the world and

1002
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,640
that's true right that will always be

1003
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,510
true there's always going to be

1004
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:54,470
criminals there's always going to be

1005
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:56,990
terrorists whether they're at your

1006
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,880
Church whether they're across the ocean

1007
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,520
there are people out there who are angry

1008
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,070
they're disenfranchised they're violent

1009
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:08,119
and they just want to harm something

1010
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:10,190
they want to change something even in a

1011
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:13,970
negative way because that's what they

1012
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:18,350
feel is all they have left which these

1013
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,850
are criminals right these are people

1014
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:22,130
that we don't need to pity but if we

1015
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:23,570
ever want to stop it we do need to

1016
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:25,250
understand it and where those things

1017
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,690
come from where there's there's drives

1018
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:30,550
come from in the first place but

1019
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:32,630
basically everybody went alright how do

1020
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,400
we stop this because nobody wants to

1021
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,750
feel unsafe nobody wants to feel like

1022
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,040
the building's gonna come down then the

1023
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,110
next time you go in it and so everybody

1024
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:43,400
just went I don't care who does it stop

1025
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,650
it and they said this to Dick Cheney

1026
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:48,560
which is a historic mistake but cuz date

1027
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,260
Dick Cheney knows how government works

1028
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:54,500
he was the person in that White House

1029
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,230
who was best placed to know all the

1030
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,670
levers of government all the interagency

1031
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:00,410
cooperation where we were strong where

1032
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:02,750
were weak what we could do what we were

1033
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:06,410
not allowed to do and what he did was he

1034
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:08,150
took that little dial on what we're not

1035
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:10,790
allowed to do and he changed it all the

1036
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:12,980
way until it broke and snapped off and

1037
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,450
then there was nothing that we couldn't

1038
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:17,840
do anymore and you were in there why

1039
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,970
this was happening this was this no I

1040
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:27,140
was I was not again this is 2001 I was I

1041
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,030
was 18 years old I was working on the

1042
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,200
base I had drove past the building but

1043
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,970
that was it this is all hindsight this

1044
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:33,650
is biography this is documented history

1045
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:36,200
but this is not you know the Gospel of

1046
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,060
Edward Snowden I I don't know this right

1047
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,859
this is public record this is Ken what

1048
00:41:39,859 --> 00:41:45,950
we all know what we have though the the

1049
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,270
reason that I bring this up is this is a

1050
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:48,680
teachable moment because there's so many

1051
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,359
people right now in the Trump

1052
00:41:50,359 --> 00:41:54,050
administration who go look this guy has

1053
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:56,359
too much power he's abusing it against

1054
00:41:56,359 --> 00:41:57,740
immigrants he's abusing it against

1055
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,300
domestic ponents he's doing whatever

1056
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,609
he's trying to hurt political rivals in

1057
00:42:01,609 --> 00:42:04,100
the next election all of this stuff and

1058
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,240
you know we can get into this stuff

1059
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,700
later if you want in detail but the

1060
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,590
bottom line is they're going this is a

1061
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,640
guy

1062
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,050
who's in the White House is throwing

1063
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:13,910
elbows right he doesn't really care he

1064
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:17,000
wants to hurt people as long as he can

1065
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,920
convince the Americans that those are

1066
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,780
the bad guys right that's the enemy

1067
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,309
doesn't matter if they're far away it

1068
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:24,280
doesn't matter if they're close at home

1069
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,200
whoever he's against he's gonna harm and

1070
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,890
the dark thing is this is actually why

1071
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:35,720
he was elected in moments of fear where

1072
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,730
the world starts falling apart and this

1073
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:39,140
happens in a thornton country after

1074
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,630
country this is why you have Vladimir

1075
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:44,450
Putin in Russia who's been there for 20

1076
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:48,079
years right president for basically 20

1077
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:50,480
years think about that you know he sort

1078
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,880
of skipped in the middle there because

1079
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,520
he had to dodge the fact that presidents

1080
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,140
can only serve so many consecutive terms

1081
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:58,490
so he dropped down a prime minister and

1082
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:01,069
then came back as president but think

1083
00:43:01,069 --> 00:43:02,960
about that how do you get that kind of

1084
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,540
political longevity and it's because if

1085
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,859
you know anything about Russian history

1086
00:43:06,859 --> 00:43:08,240
which you know I even I don't know that

1087
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,490
much about it the 90s after the collapse

1088
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:11,690
of the Soviet Union we're an

1089
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:14,240
extraordinarily dark time if you look at

1090
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,760
Russian cinema all they had or gangster

1091
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,410
movies right all they had were the

1092
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:20,119
disintegration of society how things are

1093
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:22,579
dark and broken no one trusts each other

1094
00:43:22,579 --> 00:43:24,049
pensions were no longer being paid

1095
00:43:24,049 --> 00:43:26,299
Social Security's not there anymore like

1096
00:43:26,299 --> 00:43:28,040
there's nothing to buy there's nothing

1097
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,380
to do there's no job no one had a future

1098
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:33,380
and so they went if there's somebody who

1099
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:34,579
can lead us out of this if there's

1100
00:43:34,579 --> 00:43:36,559
somebody who will fix this who will find

1101
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:38,299
us an enemy and defeat that enemy to

1102
00:43:38,299 --> 00:43:40,460
restore prosperity we'll put them in

1103
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:42,920
office we see it happen in Turkey with

1104
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,280
Iran right we've seen it happen

1105
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,960
successively with bad governments even

1106
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,809
in Western democracies we see it

1107
00:43:50,809 --> 00:43:54,829
happening sadly in places like Poland

1108
00:43:54,829 --> 00:43:55,430
and Hungary

1109
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:58,400
you can even argue it's happening in the

1110
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,130
United Kingdom right and now there are a

1111
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:02,869
lot of people arguing that sisk exactly

1112
00:44:02,869 --> 00:44:04,369
what we're seeing with Donald Trump's

1113
00:44:04,369 --> 00:44:06,619
White House in the United States and

1114
00:44:06,619 --> 00:44:09,380
this is the lesson that we didn't learn

1115
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:14,630
from 2001 is when we become fearful we

1116
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:18,710
become vulnerable right to anyone who

1117
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:20,420
promises they will make things better

1118
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:21,920
even if they have no ability to make

1119
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,810
things better even if they will actively

1120
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:25,610
things worse even if they will make

1121
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:27,470
things better for themselves and their

1122
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:31,100
buddies by taking from you but if they

1123
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,470
tell you that they'll make things better

1124
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:35,390
and you believe them

1125
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:38,750
in a moment of fear that typically leads

1126
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:40,850
to unfortunate outcomes so sorry let me

1127
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:41,990
let me turn this back over to you

1128
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:44,030
because we got way off track there no

1129
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:45,830
that's all right I want to bring it back

1130
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:47,090
to the initial question so you're

1131
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:49,400
working for the NSA when do you realize

1132
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,620
there's a huge issue and when do you

1133
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:54,380
feel this responsibility to let the

1134
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:55,910
American people know about this issue

1135
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:58,010
like when when do you contact these

1136
00:44:58,010 --> 00:44:59,510
journalists and what was the thought

1137
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:02,090
process regarding this like what what

1138
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:03,740
steps did you go through once you

1139
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,900
realize that this was in violation of

1140
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,030
the Constitution and that even with the

1141
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:09,560
laws of the Patriot Act in the Patriot

1142
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,900
Act two things had changed so radically

1143
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:15,470
that you knew this was wrong and you had

1144
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:16,970
to do something about it you felt a

1145
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:20,450
responsibility to speak out okay

1146
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:22,070
so since we gave so much historical

1147
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:23,720
preamble let me just give the the Cliff

1148
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,740
Notes version okay to get us up to that

1149
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:30,500
so after September 11th I'm a little bit

1150
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,240
lost I'm doing my technical stuff but it

1151
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,590
doesn't really feel like it matters

1152
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:35,150
anymore like I'm making more money I'm

1153
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:37,760
becoming more accomplished but the

1154
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,890
world's on fire right if you remember

1155
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:42,710
there was a crazy mood of patriotism in

1156
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:43,370
the country

1157
00:45:43,370 --> 00:45:44,660
because we were all trying to come

1158
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,220
together get through it you remember

1159
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:48,320
like people were sticking Dixie Cups on

1160
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,850
the top of every chain-link fence on

1161
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:51,530
every overpass that was like stand

1162
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:53,840
together you know never forget mm-hmm

1163
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,920
united we stand flags on every car

1164
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,840
exactly and you know I was a young young

1165
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,270
guy who is not especially political

1166
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:05,690
right and I come from a military

1167
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:08,210
background federal family all that stuff

1168
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:10,670
and so that means I'm very vulnerable to

1169
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:11,990
this kind of stuff I see it on the news

1170
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:15,350
and Bush and all his sort of cronies are

1171
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:18,800
going look it's al Qaeda it's terrorism

1172
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,750
terrorist organization they have all

1173
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:22,160
these international connections

1174
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,280
there's Iraq you know dictators weapons

1175
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,750
of mass destruction they're holding the

1176
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:29,330
world at ransom you got Colin Powell at

1177
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:31,460
the UN dangling little vials of like

1178
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:33,730
fake anthrax

1179
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:35,680
and so I felt an obligation to do my

1180
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,120
part and so I've volunteered to join the

1181
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,670
army yeah you you probably can't tell

1182
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:40,960
from from looking at me but I'm not

1183
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,180
gonna be at the top of the MMA circuit

1184
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:47,620
anytime soon so it didn't work out I

1185
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:49,870
joined a special program that was called

1186
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:51,700
the 18 X ray program where they take you

1187
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,050
in off the street and they actually give

1188
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:54,580
you a shot at becoming a Special Forces

1189
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:57,910
soldier so you train harder and special

1190
00:46:57,910 --> 00:47:00,100
platoons you go further and I ended up

1191
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,110
breaking my legs basically so they put

1192
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:04,000
me out of your legs discharged

1193
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,520
yeah it was basically what it was when

1194
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,950
they were shin splints that I was too

1195
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:12,040
dumb to get off of right so I kept

1196
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,450
marching under wait I'm a pretty light

1197
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:16,030
guy to begin with I had a 24 inch waist

1198
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:19,000
when I when I joined the army girls are

1199
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,030
jealous my way yeah I think I weighed

1200
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:24,450
like a hundred and twenty-eight pounds

1201
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:27,520
III got I was in great shape you know in

1202
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,260
boot camp because I came up really quick

1203
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:32,290
because it was a you know all I could do

1204
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:35,920
was gain but it was it was just too much

1205
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,600
on my frame because I wasn't that that

1206
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:41,860
active and so when you keep running on a

1207
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,720
stress injury right and you're running

1208
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,160
under weight with like rucksacks and

1209
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,540
things like that you're running in like

1210
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:49,780
boots and then you're doing exercises

1211
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:51,340
and the Army's like a whole chapter in

1212
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:53,500
the book you you got your battle buddy

1213
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:54,820
right because they never allow you to be

1214
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:56,590
alone I was gonna have somebody watching

1215
00:47:56,590 --> 00:48:00,550
you they thought it was funny to put me

1216
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:02,680
the smallest guy in the platoon that the

1217
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,780
drill sergeants did with the biggest

1218
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:06,400
dude in the platoon it was like an

1219
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,940
amateur bodybuilders like you know 230

1220
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:10,930
260 something like that he's a big

1221
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:14,230
fellow and so you know he would uh when

1222
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:15,670
we're off in the woods doing these these

1223
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:17,140
marches and things like that we have to

1224
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:18,580
practice but he carries like the

1225
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:20,320
fireman's carry and things like that he

1226
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,450
throws me around his neck you know I'm

1227
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:24,130
like a towel he's just skipping down

1228
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:26,410
like it's nothing and then I gotta put

1229
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:28,750
him on me and I'm just like oh god die

1230
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:33,460
and it was it was it was weirdly fun I I

1231
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:35,620
enjoyed it but it was no good for my

1232
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:36,700
body and so in a land navigation

1233
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:39,910
movement I step off a log because I was

1234
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:41,800
on point and on the other side of the

1235
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,300
log because it's the woods in Georgia

1236
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,300
I'm at Sand Hill

1237
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:51,359
I see a snake and so in my memory you

1238
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:54,420
know it's like time slows down because

1239
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:56,400
North Carolina you know where I grew up

1240
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,180
you think all snakes are poisonous sorry

1241
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:02,339
there's an issue we know we're good it's

1242
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:04,020
completely fine no we're fine I just

1243
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:05,430
there was something that happened on the

1244
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:06,829
screen I wanted to make sure it was okay

1245
00:49:06,829 --> 00:49:09,270
no that's just so by joining the chat

1246
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:11,460
that's what I was worried about ii

1247
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:15,869
opened up here yeah so anyway I try to

1248
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:18,829
take a much longer step in midair I land

1249
00:49:18,829 --> 00:49:23,579
badly and it's it's just one leg is like

1250
00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:24,990
fire I'm limping I'm limping and

1251
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:27,660
whipping but you know everybody says

1252
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,220
don't go to sick call cuz you go to sick

1253
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:30,839
call you lose your slot you'll end up

1254
00:49:30,839 --> 00:49:34,190
general infantry our regular infantry

1255
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:38,099
and so I go back I just tough it out I

1256
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:40,200
get my rack in the next morning when I

1257
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,849
get out of the rack which is the the top

1258
00:49:41,849 --> 00:49:44,010
bunk bed right

1259
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:46,560
I jump down in my legs they just give

1260
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,020
out underneath me and I try to get up in

1261
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:51,180
and I just can't get up and so I got a

1262
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:52,770
sick call and I end up going to the

1263
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:55,230
hospital and they end up x-ray and me

1264
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:56,640
and they also x-rayed my battle buddy

1265
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:57,750
because I gotta go there was somebody

1266
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:00,780
else and he has a broken hip where they

1267
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:02,760
had to bring him to surgery and it's in

1268
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,560
the book there's a lot more detail about

1269
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,349
it was kind of a dramatic moment but for

1270
00:50:07,349 --> 00:50:09,210
me they just said I had bilateral tibial

1271
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:11,099
fractures right all the way up my legs

1272
00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:15,230
they said I had spiderwebs and the next

1273
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:18,599
phase of the training was jump school

1274
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:20,730
right where you gotta jump out of a

1275
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:23,690
plane and the doctor you know I was like

1276
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:24,930
son

1277
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:28,500
if you jump on those legs they're gonna

1278
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,869
turn into powder and he's like I can

1279
00:50:30,869 --> 00:50:34,680
hold you back you know we can put you

1280
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,420
for like six months you stay off them

1281
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:38,880
then you can go back through through the

1282
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,740
whole cycle right start basic from

1283
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:43,950
scratch but you'll lose your slot in the

1284
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:47,069
special forces pipeline because of the

1285
00:50:47,069 --> 00:50:48,180
way these things are scheduled and

1286
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:49,859
everything like that and then you'll

1287
00:50:49,859 --> 00:50:51,180
basically be reassigned to the needs of

1288
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:55,740
the army or which probably meant I was

1289
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:57,359
going back to IT which was what I joined

1290
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:58,040
the army

1291
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:03,170
kind of escape or you can go out on this

1292
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:04,880
special kind of discharge that's called

1293
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,470
an administrative discharge right

1294
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:08,630
normally got honorable discharge

1295
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:10,190
dishonorable discharge things like that

1296
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:11,690
this is something for people who have

1297
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:13,610
been in for I think less than six months

1298
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:15,890
where it's like a mulling a marriage

1299
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:18,470
it's as if it never happened is is if

1300
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:22,100
you never joined and at the time I was

1301
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:23,510
like well you know that's very kind of

1302
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:25,190
him to do that

1303
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:27,410
and I took it you know they they dissent

1304
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:30,400
me to sit call or sorry the sickbay

1305
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,630
where you're in like the medical platoon

1306
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:37,580
and you do nothing for I think about a

1307
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:40,940
month and then then they let you out

1308
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:43,340
once the paperwork all finishes but in

1309
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:46,190
hindsight I realized that if you take it

1310
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:49,100
administrative discharge it exempts the

1311
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:52,610
army for liability for your injuries so

1312
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,050
actually what I thought was a kindness

1313
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:56,540
was just you know now if I had future

1314
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:59,120
problems with my legs they wouldn't have

1315
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,530
to cover it or health insurance on any

1316
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:02,600
of those things anyways it was just a

1317
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,040
funny thing but anyway I get out of the

1318
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:09,560
army and here I'm on crutches for a long

1319
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:12,740
time and just sort of trying to figure

1320
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:16,360
out all right well what's next in life

1321
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:19,460
because I had gotten basic security

1322
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:21,740
clearance just for going through signing

1323
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:24,770
up for the military process I applied

1324
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:28,340
for a security guard position at the

1325
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:30,140
University of Maryland because it said

1326
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:31,910
you had to get a top-secret clearance

1327
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:33,260
which was with a higher clearance than I

1328
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:36,380
had at time and I went well that sounds

1329
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:38,360
good because I knew if I combine my IT

1330
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:41,000
skills which were now suddenly much more

1331
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,950
relevant again to my future with the

1332
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:44,840
top-secret security clearance because of

1333
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,580
the way it works if you have a

1334
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,470
top-secret security clearance and tech

1335
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:50,300
skills you get paid a ridiculous amount

1336
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:53,090
of money for doing very little work so I

1337
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:54,710
was like alright well you know I can

1338
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:56,360
basically make twice what I would be

1339
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,060
making in the private sector working for

1340
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:00,440
government at this level at this phase

1341
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,720
because what we talked about earlier

1342
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,640
with September 11th and how the

1343
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,190
intelligence community change they no

1344
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:09,320
longer cared that I hadn't graduated

1345
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,290
from college right and I had gotten

1346
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:13,180
GED just by going in and taking a test

1347
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:16,000
so for government purposes it was the

1348
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,500
same as if I was a high school graduate

1349
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:20,590
so now suddenly it was like these these

1350
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:23,440
doors are open now this University of

1351
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,980
Maryland facility turned out to be an

1352
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:32,080
NSA facility it was called a castle the

1353
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,490
center for the Advanced Study of

1354
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:35,530
language at the University of Maryland

1355
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:40,090
College Park and all I was was literally

1356
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:42,280
a security guy walking around with with

1357
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,930
a walkie-talkie making sure nobody

1358
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:46,030
breaks in at night managing the

1359
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:48,040
electronic alarm system and things like

1360
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:52,120
that but once I had my foot in the door

1361
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:54,820
there I could start climbing ladder step

1362
00:53:54,820 --> 00:54:00,070
by step and I applied for or I went to a

1363
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:03,070
job fair actually that was only for

1364
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:06,580
people who had security clearances and I

1365
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:08,050
ended up going to the table for one of

1366
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:09,520
the technical companies it was a little

1367
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,230
tiny subcontractor nobody's ever heard

1368
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:15,640
of and they said you know we've got tons

1369
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,920
of positions for somebody like you

1370
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,650
are you comfortable working nights and I

1371
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:22,840
was like yeah you know I wake up in the

1372
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,880
middle of day anyway that that's fine

1373
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:25,440
with me

1374
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:30,430
and suddenly I've gone from working for

1375
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:33,400
the NSA through a university in a weird

1376
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,990
way where it's like the NSA holds the

1377
00:54:34,990 --> 00:54:37,570
clearance but I'm formerly an employee

1378
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:39,040
of the state of Maryland at the the

1379
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,540
college and this is government man it's

1380
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:43,090
all these weird dodges and boondoggles

1381
00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:45,220
for how people are employed there now

1382
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:48,570
suddenly I'm working at CIA headquarters

1383
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:51,070
right the place where all the movies

1384
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:52,990
show you swoop over the marble seal and

1385
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:55,360
everything like that I'm the king of the

1386
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,800
castle right I'm there at the middle of

1387
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,230
the night when no one else is there the

1388
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:01,570
lights are on motion sensors it's the

1389
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:03,460
creepiest thing in the world there's

1390
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:05,770
like flags on the wall that are just

1391
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:07,990
like gently billowing in the

1392
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:10,750
air-conditioning like ghosts the hallway

1393
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:12,820
lights up as you walk alongside it

1394
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:14,440
because it's like a green building and

1395
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:17,680
they disappear behind you and there's

1396
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,060
there's no one there I can go down to

1397
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:21,610
the gym at like 2:00 o'clock in the

1398
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,320
morning at the CIA

1399
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,600
and it's like not see a soul on the

1400
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,740
other side of the building then go all

1401
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:30,700
the way back and this kind of thing was

1402
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,260
was my end because they were like look

1403
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:35,440
it's the nightshift nothing that bad is

1404
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,560
gonna happen um but it was on a very

1405
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:41,890
senior technical team that was basically

1406
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:43,690
handling systems administration for

1407
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:46,390
everybody in the Washington Metropolitan

1408
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:52,020
Area right so every basically CIA server

1409
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:54,760
this is a computer system that like data

1410
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,950
is stored on the reporting is stored on

1411
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:59,440
that traffic is moved on all of this

1412
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,550
stuff

1413
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:09,060
suddenly me this is a circa 2005 I think

1414
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:13,360
I'm in charge of and it's just me and

1415
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,370
one other guy on the night shift and if

1416
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:16,570
you're interested in the book there's a

1417
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:20,890
lot of detail on this but I get sort of

1418
00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:22,420
scouted from this position because they

1419
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,650
realize I actually know a lot about

1420
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:26,200
technology they were expecting me just

1421
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,600
to basically make sure the building

1422
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,310
doesn't burn down all these systems

1423
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:33,640
don't go down overnight and then never

1424
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:37,570
come back up but they go well are you

1425
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:40,990
willing to go overseas and to a young

1426
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:42,700
man at that age that's actually like hey

1427
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,050
that sounds kind of exciting you know

1428
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:46,060
who doesn't want to go work overseas for

1429
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:49,900
the CIA and there's a lot of people

1430
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,850
listening the podcast who are like oh

1431
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:57,850
not me wait the CIA's the bad guys right

1432
00:56:57,850 --> 00:56:59,230
yeah exactly they're like what are you

1433
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:00,040
gonna go overthrow a government

1434
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:02,380
somewhere but you have to understand

1435
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:04,660
that I'm still very much a true believer

1436
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:06,700
the government is like the living

1437
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:09,220
compressed embodiment of truth and

1438
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:11,290
goodness and light you know the shining

1439
00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:13,630
city on the hill so I want to do my part

1440
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:16,930
to spread that to the world I didn't

1441
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:20,020
have skepticism is really what I'm

1442
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:23,560
trying to establish here and so I sign

1443
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,210
up and I go through this special

1444
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:27,130
training school like people hear in

1445
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:29,710
movies about the farm which is down at

1446
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:32,380
Camp Peary in Virginia I'm sent that's

1447
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:35,599
actually much more secret facility

1448
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:38,480
called the hill which is in Warrenton

1449
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:43,400
Virginia and this is been covered a few

1450
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:47,240
times and open-source media but I think

1451
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:49,240
this is one of the few book length

1452
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:51,849
discussions of what happens there in

1453
00:57:51,849 --> 00:57:54,640
permanent record

1454
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,170
but yeah so I go through training and

1455
00:57:57,170 --> 00:57:59,240
then I get assigned overseas and I end

1456
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,500
up in Geneva Switzerland

1457
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,480
undercover as a diplomat right I think

1458
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:06,109
I'm my formal title for the embassy is

1459
00:58:06,109 --> 00:58:08,029
like something super playing like

1460
00:58:08,029 --> 00:58:11,839
diplomatic attache and what I am is I'm

1461
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:13,640
a forward deployed tech guy they send

1462
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,470
you through this school to make you into

1463
00:58:15,470 --> 00:58:18,890
kind of a MacGyver right yes you can

1464
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:21,170
handle all the computers but you can

1465
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:24,380
also handle the connections for the

1466
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:27,339
Embassy's Power Systems right the actual

1467
00:58:27,339 --> 00:58:29,960
electrical connections you can handle

1468
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,720
the HVAC systems right you can handle

1469
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:35,829
locks and alarms and security systems

1470
00:58:35,829 --> 00:58:38,210
basically anything that's got an on

1471
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:40,369
button on it at the Embassy that's

1472
00:58:40,369 --> 00:58:43,490
secure now you're responsible for and I

1473
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:47,059
traveled from Geneva to other countries

1474
00:58:47,059 --> 00:58:50,390
in Europe for sort of assignments and it

1475
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:52,519
was like it was an exciting time I

1476
00:58:52,519 --> 00:58:56,930
actually still enjoyed it but this was

1477
00:58:56,930 --> 00:58:59,630
where I first working with intelligence

1478
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:01,670
started to get doubts and the story's

1479
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:03,740
been told many times so I won't go over

1480
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:10,240
in full detail here but the CIA does

1481
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,349
primarily and it's not the only thing

1482
00:59:12,349 --> 00:59:15,640
they do what's called human intelligence

1483
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:18,920
now there are many different types of

1484
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,900
intelligence than the intelligence

1485
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:25,099
community is responsible for the primary

1486
00:59:25,099 --> 00:59:27,799
ones are human intelligence and signals

1487
00:59:27,799 --> 00:59:28,849
intelligence you want to think of

1488
00:59:28,849 --> 00:59:31,970
signals intelligence right as tapping

1489
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:36,049
lines hacking computers all of these

1490
00:59:36,049 --> 00:59:37,970
sort of things that provide electronic

1491
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:40,640
information anything that's digital or

1492
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,740
analog signal that can be intercepted

1493
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:44,839
then turned into information human

1494
00:59:44,839 --> 00:59:47,000
intelligence is you know all that fun

1495
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,270
stuff we've heard the CI

1496
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:52,020
for decades and decades which is where

1497
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:54,480
they try to turn people basically they

1498
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,830
say look we'll give you money if you

1499
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:59,370
sell out your country they don't it's

1500
00:59:59,370 --> 01:00:01,110
not even your country a lot of times

1501
01:00:01,110 --> 01:00:03,420
it's your like organization these guys

1502
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:04,170
could be working for a

1503
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:06,540
telecommunications provider and they

1504
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:08,010
want to sell customer records over they

1505
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:09,720
worked at a bank which was the thing

1506
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:11,790
that I saw and we wanted records on the

1507
01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:13,470
banks customers so he wanted a guy on

1508
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:17,400
the inside but anyway that that's sort

1509
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,470
of how it works and what I saw was they

1510
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:24,480
were way more aggressive for the lowest

1511
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,820
stakes than was reasonable or

1512
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:29,430
responsible they were totally willing to

1513
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:32,130
destroy somebody's life just on the off

1514
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:33,810
chance they would get some information

1515
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:35,210
that would that wouldn't even be a

1516
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:38,250
tremendously valuable and so you know

1517
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:42,270
ethically thatthat struck me as a bit

1518
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:46,620
off but I let it pass because what I

1519
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:50,970
what I've learned over my life short

1520
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:55,320
though it's it's been you know it's that

1521
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,880
skepticism is something that needs to

1522
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,650
build up over time it's a skill

1523
01:00:58,650 --> 01:01:00,870
something that needs to be practiced or

1524
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:03,090
you can think of it as something that

1525
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:05,040
you developed through exposure I kind of

1526
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,350
like a radiation poisoning but in a

1527
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:09,900
positive way it's when you start to

1528
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:14,880
realize inconsistencies or hypocrisy

1529
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:20,790
that Ward lies and you notice them and

1530
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:22,350
you know you you give somebody the

1531
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:24,630
benefit of the doubt or you trust them

1532
01:01:24,630 --> 01:01:25,710
or you think it's all right but then

1533
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:28,590
over time you see it's not an isolated

1534
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:30,630
instance it's a pattern behavior and

1535
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:34,260
over time that exposure to inconsistency

1536
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:35,940
builds and builds and builds until it's

1537
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:37,880
something that you can no longer ignore

1538
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:43,050
now after the CIA I went to the NSA in

1539
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:45,470
Japan where I was working there in Tokyo

1540
01:01:45,470 --> 01:01:48,360
and then from there a couple years later

1541
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:53,280
I went to the CIA again now I was

1542
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,780
working as a private employee for Dell

1543
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:56,850
but I was the senior technical official

1544
01:01:56,850 --> 01:01:59,940
on Dells Sales Account the CIA

1545
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:01,470
you know people these big companies they

1546
01:02:01,470 --> 01:02:01,920
have say

1547
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,290
accounts to the CIA and so this means

1548
01:02:04,290 --> 01:02:06,660
I'm going in and now it's crazy because

1549
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:08,640
I'm still a very young man but I'm

1550
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,710
sitting across the table from Chiefs of

1551
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:12,960
these enormous CIA divisions I'm sitting

1552
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,609
across from their chief technology

1553
01:02:14,609 --> 01:02:17,549
officer for the entire agency or the

1554
01:02:17,549 --> 01:02:19,559
chief intelligent her chief information

1555
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:23,520
officer for the entire CIA and these

1556
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,109
guys are going look here's a problems

1557
01:02:25,109 --> 01:02:26,280
here's what we want to do and it's my

1558
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:29,430
job to pitch them a system right and

1559
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:31,380
I've got paired up with this sales guy

1560
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:33,660
and the whole thing is just go how much

1561
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:35,640
money can we get out of the government

1562
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,890
right that's the whole goal and we'll

1563
01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:39,750
build them what we were pitching was a

1564
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:41,579
private cloud system right everybody

1565
01:02:41,579 --> 01:02:44,069
knows about cloud computing now it's

1566
01:02:44,069 --> 01:02:46,140
like why your Gmail account is available

1567
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:47,819
wherever you go it's why Facebook has

1568
01:02:47,819 --> 01:02:50,549
this massive system of records for

1569
01:02:50,549 --> 01:02:52,859
everyone everywhere the government

1570
01:02:52,859 --> 01:02:53,940
wanted to have these kind of

1571
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:55,710
capabilities to Dell ended up getting

1572
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:58,920
beat out by Amazon people well you know

1573
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:00,089
some people aren't familiar with this

1574
01:03:00,089 --> 01:03:03,030
many of them are but Amazon runs a

1575
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:06,589
secret cloud system for the government I

1576
01:03:06,589 --> 01:03:09,930
forget what they've rebranded it now but

1577
01:03:09,930 --> 01:03:11,640
this is just there's this massive

1578
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:14,069
connection between industry and

1579
01:03:14,069 --> 01:03:15,839
government in the classified space that

1580
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:17,130
just goes deeper and deeper and deeper

1581
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:20,700
and deeper but at this point I I was

1582
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:23,369
already I had misgivings because of what

1583
01:03:23,369 --> 01:03:26,250
I'd seen in Japan about government but I

1584
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:30,450
was just trying to get by I was trying

1585
01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:33,299
to ignore the conflicts I was trying to

1586
01:03:33,299 --> 01:03:36,780
ignore the inconsistencies and I think

1587
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:40,109
this is a state that a lot of people in

1588
01:03:40,109 --> 01:03:43,020
these large institutions not just in our

1589
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:45,210
country but around the world I struggle

1590
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:46,440
with every day right there they got a

1591
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,630
job they got a family they got bills

1592
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:51,119
that they're just trying to get by and

1593
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:52,920
they know that some of the things

1594
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,049
they're doing are not good things they

1595
01:03:55,049 --> 01:03:56,250
know some of the things they're doing

1596
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:59,339
are actively wrong but they know what

1597
01:03:59,339 --> 01:04:03,380
happens to people who rock the boat

1598
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,790
eventually

1599
01:04:06,790 --> 01:04:12,400
I changed my mind and when I had gone to

1600
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:16,030
Hawaii which was the final position in

1601
01:04:16,030 --> 01:04:17,290
my career with the intelligence

1602
01:04:17,290 --> 01:04:25,000
community I was because of an accident

1603
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,010
of history here I wasn't supposed to be

1604
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:29,590
in this position at all I was supposed

1605
01:04:29,590 --> 01:04:32,500
to be at a group called the national

1606
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:36,310
threat Operations Center and talk but

1607
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:38,530
because of the way contracting works and

1608
01:04:38,530 --> 01:04:44,260
again this is covered in the book I end

1609
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:46,780
up being reassigned to this little

1610
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:49,750
rinky-dink office that nobody's ever

1611
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:51,940
heard of in the light called the Office

1612
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:55,440
of information sharing and I'm replacing

1613
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:58,270
this old-timer who's about to retire a

1614
01:04:58,270 --> 01:05:01,480
really really nice guy but he spent most

1615
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,490
of his days just reading novels and

1616
01:05:03,490 --> 01:05:06,130
doing nothing and letting people be

1617
01:05:06,130 --> 01:05:08,200
content to the fact there are letting

1618
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,030
people forget that his office existed

1619
01:05:10,030 --> 01:05:12,150
because he was the only one in it

1620
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:14,350
there's there's a manager who's like

1621
01:05:14,350 --> 01:05:16,660
over him but it's actually over a larger

1622
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:18,610
group and he just looks over him as sort

1623
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:21,700
of a favor so now I come in and now I'm

1624
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:23,680
the sole employee of the office of

1625
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,270
information sharing but I'm not close

1626
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:28,390
enough to retirement that I'm ok with

1627
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:31,750
just doing nothing at all so I get in

1628
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:34,150
business and I come up with this idea

1629
01:05:34,150 --> 01:05:36,780
for a new system called the heartbeat

1630
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:41,970
and what the heartbeat is gonna do is

1631
01:05:41,970 --> 01:05:45,850
connect to basically every information

1632
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:48,490
repository in the intelligence community

1633
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:51,730
both at the NSA and across Network

1634
01:05:51,730 --> 01:05:53,230
boundaries which you normally can't

1635
01:05:53,230 --> 01:05:54,820
cross but because I've worked at both

1636
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:58,030
the CIA and the NSA I knew the network

1637
01:05:58,030 --> 01:06:00,010
well enough both sides of it sides that

1638
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:01,750
normal workers at the NSA would never

1639
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:03,310
have seen because you have to be in one

1640
01:06:03,310 --> 01:06:05,080
or the other I could actually connect

1641
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:06,610
these together I could build bridges

1642
01:06:06,610 --> 01:06:11,320
across this kind of network space and

1643
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:14,950
then draw all of these or

1644
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:18,609
records into a new kind of system that

1645
01:06:18,609 --> 01:06:21,300
was supposed to look at your digital ID

1646
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:25,300
basically your your sort of ID card that

1647
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:27,910
says this is who I am I work for this

1648
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:30,970
agency I work in this office these are

1649
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:33,400
my assignments these are my group

1650
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:36,040
affiliations and because of that the

1651
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:38,190
system would be able to eventually

1652
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:40,930
aggregate records that were relevant to

1653
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:43,450
your job that were related to you and

1654
01:06:43,450 --> 01:06:44,859
then it could provide them and basically

1655
01:06:44,859 --> 01:06:47,109
you could hit this site it would be an

1656
01:06:47,109 --> 01:06:48,520
update of what we used to call read

1657
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:52,960
boards which were manually created there

1658
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:57,339
we go look you work in network defense

1659
01:06:57,339 --> 01:06:58,660
right these are all the things that are

1660
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:00,339
happening on a network defense you work

1661
01:07:00,339 --> 01:07:03,280
on I don't know economic takeovers in

1662
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,829
Guatemala you know if this is what's

1663
01:07:05,829 --> 01:07:09,460
going on for you there but in my off

1664
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:13,180
time I helped the team that sat next to

1665
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:14,859
me which was a systems administration

1666
01:07:14,859 --> 01:07:16,839
team for a for Windows Networks because

1667
01:07:16,839 --> 01:07:18,700
I had been microsoft certified systems

1668
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:22,210
engineer' which means basically I knew

1669
01:07:22,210 --> 01:07:25,180
how to take care of Windows networks and

1670
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:27,280
this was all those guys did and they

1671
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,500
always had way too much work way too

1672
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:32,230
much work and I had basically no work

1673
01:07:32,230 --> 01:07:34,349
that I needed to do at all

1674
01:07:34,349 --> 01:07:37,359
because all I was supposed to do was

1675
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:39,480
share information which was not

1676
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:43,030
something that was particularly in

1677
01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:46,450
demand because most people already knew

1678
01:07:46,450 --> 01:07:47,859
what they wanted her what they needed so

1679
01:07:47,859 --> 01:07:49,930
it was basically my job was to sit there

1680
01:07:49,930 --> 01:07:51,940
and collect a paycheck unless I wanted

1681
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:55,510
to get ambitious and so I did some side

1682
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:57,400
gigs for these other guys and one of

1683
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:58,780
them was running what were called dirty

1684
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:04,569
word searches now dirty word searches

1685
01:08:04,569 --> 01:08:08,319
are let me let me dial this back because

1686
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:12,609
I know we're sort of this is hard to

1687
01:08:12,609 --> 01:08:19,239
track everything that the NSA does in

1688
01:08:19,239 --> 01:08:22,690
large part is classified everything the

1689
01:08:22,690 --> 01:08:27,380
CIA does in large part is classified

1690
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:30,449
if I made lunch plans with other people

1691
01:08:30,449 --> 01:08:33,299
in my office it was classified that was

1692
01:08:33,299 --> 01:08:35,699
the policy it's dumb they this over

1693
01:08:35,699 --> 01:08:38,130
classification problem is one of the

1694
01:08:38,130 --> 01:08:40,109
central flaws in government right now

1695
01:08:40,109 --> 01:08:41,639
this is the reason we don't understand

1696
01:08:41,639 --> 01:08:42,750
what they're doing this is why they can

1697
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:45,059
get on wrong way this is why they can

1698
01:08:45,059 --> 01:08:46,559
get away with breaking the law or

1699
01:08:46,559 --> 01:08:49,079
violating our rights for so long you

1700
01:08:49,079 --> 01:08:51,150
know five years ten years fifteen fifty

1701
01:08:51,150 --> 01:08:54,389
years before they see before we see what

1702
01:08:54,389 --> 01:08:56,219
they were doing and it's because of this

1703
01:08:56,219 --> 01:09:00,750
routine classification right but every

1704
01:09:00,750 --> 01:09:04,190
system computer system has a limit on

1705
01:09:04,190 --> 01:09:06,960
what level of classified information is

1706
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,270
supposed to be stored on it and we've

1707
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:11,489
got all these complicated systems for

1708
01:09:11,489 --> 01:09:16,710
code words and caveats that establish a

1709
01:09:16,710 --> 01:09:18,449
system of what's called compartment

1710
01:09:18,449 --> 01:09:20,250
ation and this is the idea when you work

1711
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:21,809
at the CIA when you work at the NSA

1712
01:09:21,809 --> 01:09:24,089
you're not supposed to know what's

1713
01:09:24,089 --> 01:09:26,429
happening in the office next to you

1714
01:09:26,429 --> 01:09:28,650
right because you don't have

1715
01:09:28,650 --> 01:09:30,690
need-to-know right again that thing from

1716
01:09:30,690 --> 01:09:35,609
the movies and the reason they have this

1717
01:09:35,609 --> 01:09:36,989
is they don't want one person to be able

1718
01:09:36,989 --> 01:09:39,389
to go and know everything Ryan tell

1719
01:09:39,389 --> 01:09:41,969
everybody everything they don't want

1720
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:43,980
anybody to know too much particularly

1721
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:45,619
when they're doing lots of bad things

1722
01:09:45,619 --> 01:09:47,609
because then there's the risk that you

1723
01:09:47,609 --> 01:09:49,139
realize they're doing so many bad things

1724
01:09:49,139 --> 01:09:51,960
that it's passed the point that we can

1725
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:54,539
justify and they might develop sort of

1726
01:09:54,539 --> 01:09:59,460
an ideological objection to that well in

1727
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:01,440
the office of information sharing and

1728
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:03,809
actually in basically every part of my

1729
01:10:03,809 --> 01:10:06,119
career before that I had access to

1730
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:10,730
everything I had what was called a

1731
01:10:10,730 --> 01:10:14,219
special caveat on my accesses called

1732
01:10:14,219 --> 01:10:16,579
protec which means privileged access

1733
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:18,989
what this means you're kind of super

1734
01:10:18,989 --> 01:10:21,420
user you know most people have all of

1735
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:22,590
these controls and the kind of

1736
01:10:22,590 --> 01:10:24,750
information that can access but I'm in

1737
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:26,219
charge of the system right people who

1738
01:10:26,219 --> 01:10:28,110
need information they have to get it

1739
01:10:28,110 --> 01:10:29,369
from somewhere they don't know even the

1740
01:10:29,369 --> 01:10:31,860
director of the CIA right he says I need

1741
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:33,869
to know everything about this well he

1742
01:10:33,869 --> 01:10:35,340
doesn't know where to get it he's just a

1743
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:36,960
manager somebody has to be able to

1744
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,030
actually cross these thresholds and get

1745
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:39,910
those things

1746
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:42,850
that guy was me and so dirty word

1747
01:10:42,850 --> 01:10:45,670
searches were these kind of automated

1748
01:10:45,670 --> 01:10:48,160
queries that I would set up to go across

1749
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:51,070
the whole network and look at all of the

1750
01:10:51,070 --> 01:10:52,960
different levels of classification and

1751
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,910
compartment ation and exceptionally

1752
01:10:54,910 --> 01:10:57,040
controlled information that's kind of

1753
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,300
you could think of it as above top

1754
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:01,240
secret in these special compartments

1755
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:02,350
right where you're not even supposed to

1756
01:11:02,350 --> 01:11:05,050
know what these compartments are for you

1757
01:11:05,050 --> 01:11:07,960
only know the code word unless you work

1758
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:09,550
in them unless you have access to them

1759
01:11:09,550 --> 01:11:12,520
unless you read into them one day I get

1760
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:15,040
a hit on the dirty word search for a

1761
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:18,580
program that I'd never heard of called

1762
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:24,480
stellar wind it came back because the

1763
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:28,570
the little caveat for they're called

1764
01:11:28,570 --> 01:11:30,490
handling caveats which is like you know

1765
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:32,050
you can think of like Burn After Reading

1766
01:11:32,050 --> 01:11:34,510
or for your eyes only but this one's

1767
01:11:34,510 --> 01:11:34,780
called

1768
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:37,300
STL W which means stellar wind unless

1769
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:38,560
you know what stellar wind is you don't

1770
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,210
know how to handle it all I knew is it

1771
01:11:40,210 --> 01:11:42,190
wasn't supposed to be on my system you

1772
01:11:42,190 --> 01:11:44,830
know this is a little bit unusual and it

1773
01:11:44,830 --> 01:11:47,410
turned out this document was placed on

1774
01:11:47,410 --> 01:11:49,360
the system because one of the employees

1775
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:51,460
who had worked on this program years

1776
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:54,250
before had come to Hawaii and this

1777
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:57,760
person was a lawyer I believe and they

1778
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:58,690
had worked in the inspector general's

1779
01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:01,170
office and they had compiled a report

1780
01:12:01,170 --> 01:12:03,670
part of the inspector general's report

1781
01:12:03,670 --> 01:12:05,680
which is when the government is

1782
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:12,670
investigating itself into the operations

1783
01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:15,040
and activities of this program well this

1784
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,420
was the domestic mass surveillance

1785
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:19,000
program that I talked about in the very

1786
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,770
beginning of our conversation that

1787
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:22,620
started under the Bush White House

1788
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:26,050
stellar wind was no longer supposed to

1789
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:29,430
be really an operation it had been

1790
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:33,190
unveiled in a big scandal in December

1791
01:12:33,190 --> 01:12:36,520
2005 in the New York Times by journalist

1792
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:40,330
James risin and I I'm not gonna name him

1793
01:12:40,330 --> 01:12:41,250
because I don't want to get it wrong

1794
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:43,270
another journalist you can look at the

1795
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:43,969
byline

1796
01:12:43,969 --> 01:12:45,580
now if you want to see their involvement

1797
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:49,219
but and there's there's a lot of history

1798
01:12:49,219 --> 01:12:52,310
here too but um what they had found was

1799
01:12:52,310 --> 01:12:55,969
of course the Bush White House had

1800
01:12:55,969 --> 01:12:57,920
constructed a warrantless wiretapping

1801
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:59,180
program if you remember the warrantless

1802
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:01,340
wiretapping scandal that was affecting

1803
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:04,580
everyone in the United States well

1804
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:11,300
the Bush White House was really put in a

1805
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:13,520
difficult position by this scandal they

1806
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:15,920
would have lost the election over this

1807
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:17,090
scandal because the New York Times

1808
01:13:17,090 --> 01:13:22,100
actually had this story in October 2004

1809
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:23,930
which was the election year they were

1810
01:13:23,930 --> 01:13:27,949
they were ready to go with it but at

1811
01:13:27,949 --> 01:13:30,400
this specific request of the White House

1812
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:33,260
talking to the publisher of the New York

1813
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:36,290
Times Saul's burger and Bill Keller than

1814
01:13:36,290 --> 01:13:37,460
the executive editor of the New York

1815
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:41,660
Times the New York Times said we won't

1816
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:45,290
run the story because the president just

1817
01:13:45,290 --> 01:13:47,690
said if you run this story a month

1818
01:13:47,690 --> 01:13:49,670
before the election that's very tight

1819
01:13:49,670 --> 01:13:52,489
margin if you recall you'll have blood

1820
01:13:52,489 --> 01:13:54,650
on your hands and it was so close to

1821
01:13:54,650 --> 01:13:57,469
2001 the New York Times just went you

1822
01:13:57,469 --> 01:14:00,199
know what fine Americans don't need to

1823
01:14:00,199 --> 01:14:02,480
know that the kind of sushis big

1824
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:06,620
violator they don't need to know that

1825
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:08,300
the Fourth Amendment doesn't mean what

1826
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:11,270
they think it means if the government

1827
01:14:11,270 --> 01:14:13,010
says it's alright and it's a secret you

1828
01:14:13,010 --> 01:14:15,520
shouldn't know about it that's fine now

1829
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:18,290
December 2005 why did that change why

1830
01:14:18,290 --> 01:14:19,699
did the New York Times has suddenly run

1831
01:14:19,699 --> 01:14:22,270
this story well it's because James Rison

1832
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:25,610
the reporter who found this story had

1833
01:14:25,610 --> 01:14:27,590
written a book and he was about to

1834
01:14:27,590 --> 01:14:29,420
publish this book and the New York Times

1835
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:30,980
was about to be in a very uncomfortable

1836
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:33,680
position of having to explain why they

1837
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:37,070
didn't run this story and how they got

1838
01:14:37,070 --> 01:14:39,230
scooped by their own journalists and so

1839
01:14:39,230 --> 01:14:40,550
they finally did it but it was too late

1840
01:14:40,550 --> 01:14:42,680
Bush had been reelected and now he was

1841
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:44,960
sweeping up the broken glass of our lost

1842
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:49,610
rights so Congress the bush White House

1843
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:51,440
was very effective and as I said before

1844
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:54,080
telling a very few select members of

1845
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:56,389
Congress that this program existed

1846
01:14:56,389 --> 01:14:58,369
and they told them this program existed

1847
01:14:58,369 --> 01:15:01,550
in ways that they wouldn't object to but

1848
01:15:01,550 --> 01:15:04,460
made them culpable for hiding the

1849
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:06,650
existence from the program the existence

1850
01:15:06,650 --> 01:15:07,850
of the program from the American people

1851
01:15:07,850 --> 01:15:09,590
and this is why someone like Nancy

1852
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:12,080
Pelosi who you wouldn't exactly think

1853
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:13,550
would be buddy-buddy with George Bush

1854
01:15:13,550 --> 01:15:16,460
was completely okay in defending this

1855
01:15:16,460 --> 01:15:18,080
kind of program in fact and you know

1856
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,520
later she said oh well she had

1857
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,770
objections to the program that she wrote

1858
01:15:21,770 --> 01:15:23,540
in a letter the White House but she

1859
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:24,860
never showed us the letter she went on

1860
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:27,280
well that was that was classified right

1861
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:29,900
and this is not to bag on her

1862
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:31,940
individually it's just she's a great

1863
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:34,130
example in here an unnamed example

1864
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:36,350
everyone knows of how this process works

1865
01:15:36,350 --> 01:15:40,010
the White House will implicate certain

1866
01:15:40,010 --> 01:15:42,110
very powerful members of Congress in

1867
01:15:42,110 --> 01:15:43,760
their own criminal activity and so on

1868
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:46,070
when then when the White House gets in

1869
01:15:46,070 --> 01:15:48,619
trouble for it the Congress has to run

1870
01:15:48,619 --> 01:15:51,020
cover for the White House and so what

1871
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:54,050
happened was Congress passed an

1872
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:58,909
emergency law in 2007 called the protect

1873
01:15:58,909 --> 01:16:01,489
America Act now which should have been

1874
01:16:01,489 --> 01:16:03,920
our first indication this is a very bad

1875
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:05,840
thing because they never named a law

1876
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,400
something like that unless something

1877
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:11,139
terrible and what it did was it

1878
01:16:11,139 --> 01:16:14,300
retroactively Lee immunized all of the

1879
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:15,949
phone companies in the United States

1880
01:16:15,949 --> 01:16:20,060
that had been breaking the law millions

1881
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:23,900
of times a day by handing your records

1882
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:26,030
over to the government which they

1883
01:16:26,030 --> 01:16:28,280
weren't allowed to do simply on the

1884
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:29,570
basis of a letter from the president

1885
01:16:29,570 --> 01:16:33,290
saying please do this and these

1886
01:16:33,290 --> 01:16:35,060
companies went look now that we've been

1887
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:37,040
uncovered now that we've been shown that

1888
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:40,520
we're breaking or now that these

1889
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:42,590
journalists have shown that we've broken

1890
01:16:42,590 --> 01:16:44,869
the law and violated the rights of

1891
01:16:44,869 --> 01:16:47,840
Americans and a staggering scale that

1892
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:49,760
could bankrupt our companies because we

1893
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:52,730
can be sued for this we will no longer

1894
01:16:52,730 --> 01:16:55,790
cooperate with you unless you pass a law

1895
01:16:55,790 --> 01:16:58,250
that says people can't sue us for having

1896
01:16:58,250 --> 01:17:00,080
done this and so we get the Patek

1897
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:02,150
tamerica Act which stays you know as an

1898
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:04,460
emergency yeah this is all public

1899
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:06,170
history - yeah you can look this up on

1900
01:17:06,170 --> 01:17:08,380
Wikipedia you know

1901
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:14,409
and so then they they go it's an

1902
01:17:14,409 --> 01:17:16,420
emergency law we have to pass this now

1903
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:18,730
we have to keep this program active Bush

1904
01:17:18,730 --> 01:17:19,989
is going to end the warrantless

1905
01:17:19,989 --> 01:17:22,270
wiretapping program and continue it

1906
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:23,860
under this new authority where it's

1907
01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:25,809
gonna have some special level of

1908
01:17:25,809 --> 01:17:27,070
oversight and these kind of things

1909
01:17:27,070 --> 01:17:29,889
eventually but for now we just have to

1910
01:17:29,889 --> 01:17:32,230
make sure people are safe again they go

1911
01:17:32,230 --> 01:17:34,000
to fear they say if we don't have this

1912
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,969
program terrorist attacks will continue

1913
01:17:36,969 --> 01:17:39,099
you know people will die blood on your

1914
01:17:39,099 --> 01:17:40,329
hands blood on your hands blundering

1915
01:17:40,329 --> 01:17:43,750
hands think of the children protect

1916
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:46,960
America Act passes the companies get off

1917
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:48,550
the hook the Bush White House gets off

1918
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:50,530
the hook the Congress that was then

1919
01:17:50,530 --> 01:17:53,040
sharing in criminal culpability for

1920
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,989
authorizing or rather letting these

1921
01:17:55,989 --> 01:17:58,900
things go by without stopping them then

1922
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:02,219
passes in 2008 the Foreign Intelligence

1923
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:07,329
Surveillance Act Amendments of 2008 this

1924
01:18:07,329 --> 01:18:10,869
is called the the FAA 5-minutes Act of

1925
01:18:10,869 --> 01:18:15,610
2008 and rather than stopping all of the

1926
01:18:15,610 --> 01:18:19,960
unlawful and sort of unconstitutional

1927
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:21,579
activities that the intelligence agency

1928
01:18:21,579 --> 01:18:26,440
was doing they continued it in different

1929
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:29,170
ways simply by creating a few legal hubs

1930
01:18:29,170 --> 01:18:32,139
for them to jump through now this is not

1931
01:18:32,139 --> 01:18:33,790
to say you know these things aren't

1932
01:18:33,790 --> 01:18:35,440
helpful at all it's not say they're not

1933
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:37,989
useful at all but it's important to

1934
01:18:37,989 --> 01:18:40,030
understand when the government's

1935
01:18:40,030 --> 01:18:42,159
response to any scandal then this

1936
01:18:42,159 --> 01:18:46,389
applies to any country is not to make

1937
01:18:46,389 --> 01:18:48,670
the activities of the person who is

1938
01:18:48,670 --> 01:18:50,770
caught breaking the law comply with the

1939
01:18:50,770 --> 01:18:53,829
law but instead make the activities of

1940
01:18:53,829 --> 01:18:57,040
the person who is breaking the law legal

1941
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:59,800
right they make the law comply with what

1942
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,840
the agencies want to do rather than

1943
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:04,230
making the agencies comply with law

1944
01:19:04,230 --> 01:19:06,579
that's a problem and that's what

1945
01:19:06,579 --> 01:19:07,239
happened here

1946
01:19:07,239 --> 01:19:10,449
now the intelligence community's powers

1947
01:19:10,449 --> 01:19:13,540
actually grew in response to this

1948
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:16,239
scandal in 2008 because Congress was on

1949
01:19:16,239 --> 01:19:17,440
the hook and they just wanted to move on

1950
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:18,880
and get this

1951
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,770
over with there were objections there

1952
01:19:20,770 --> 01:19:22,210
were people who knew this was a bad idea

1953
01:19:22,210 --> 01:19:24,580
but it didn't passed on now what the

1954
01:19:24,580 --> 01:19:26,050
public took away from this because a

1955
01:19:26,050 --> 01:19:29,050
part of these laws was a requirement

1956
01:19:29,050 --> 01:19:33,520
that the Inspector General of all of

1957
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:34,810
these different intelligence community

1958
01:19:34,810 --> 01:19:36,310
elements and the Director of National

1959
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:41,980
Intelligence submit a report saying this

1960
01:19:41,980 --> 01:19:43,960
is what happened under that warrantless

1961
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:47,110
wiretapping program this is how it

1962
01:19:47,110 --> 01:19:48,520
complied with the law or how it didn't

1963
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:51,280
comply with the law and basically look

1964
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:55,480
back at how this program was constituted

1965
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:58,540
what it did what the impacts and effects

1966
01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:02,020
were and that was supposed to be sort of

1967
01:20:02,020 --> 01:20:04,000
the Truth and Reconciliation Council

1968
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,320
right now why am I talking about all

1969
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:10,060
this ancient history well I'm sitting

1970
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:14,470
here in 2012 with a classified Inspector

1971
01:20:14,470 --> 01:20:16,450
General's report draft report from the

1972
01:20:16,450 --> 01:20:21,790
NSA that names names that says Dick

1973
01:20:21,790 --> 01:20:23,590
Cheney it says David Addington this is

1974
01:20:23,590 --> 01:20:25,090
Nancy Pelosi that says all these people

1975
01:20:25,090 --> 01:20:26,050
who are involved in the program

1976
01:20:26,050 --> 01:20:28,540
the tick-tock of how it happens it says

1977
01:20:28,540 --> 01:20:30,910
the director of the NSA that guy who is

1978
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:33,040
evacuating the building at the beginning

1979
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:38,740
of our our our podcast here that guy was

1980
01:20:38,740 --> 01:20:40,360
asked by the President of the United

1981
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:43,060
States if he would continue this program

1982
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:46,960
after being told by the White House and

1983
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:48,790
the Department of Justice that these

1984
01:20:48,790 --> 01:20:50,560
programs were not lawful that they were

1985
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:53,080
not constitutional and the president

1986
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:57,880
said would you continue this program on

1987
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:00,810
my say-so alone knowing that it's risky

1988
01:21:00,810 --> 01:21:03,400
knowing that it's unlawful and he said

1989
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:04,630
yes sir I will

1990
01:21:04,630 --> 01:21:06,280
if you think that's what's necessary to

1991
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:09,100
keep the country safe and at that moment

1992
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:12,820
I realize these guys don't care about

1993
01:21:12,820 --> 01:21:14,200
the law these guys don't care about the

1994
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:15,670
Constitution these guys don't care about

1995
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:17,710
the American people they care about the

1996
01:21:17,710 --> 01:21:19,180
continuity of government they care about

1997
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:20,980
the state right and this is something

1998
01:21:20,980 --> 01:21:23,410
that people have lost we hear this

1999
01:21:23,410 --> 01:21:25,060
phrase over and over again national

2000
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:26,800
security national security national

2001
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,420
security and we're meant to interpret

2002
01:21:28,420 --> 01:21:29,210
that

2003
01:21:29,210 --> 01:21:32,510
to mean public safety but national

2004
01:21:32,510 --> 01:21:33,770
security is a very different thing from

2005
01:21:33,770 --> 01:21:35,480
public safety national security is a

2006
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:36,980
thing that in previous generations we

2007
01:21:36,980 --> 01:21:40,550
referred to as state security national

2008
01:21:40,550 --> 01:21:42,739
security was a kind of term that came

2009
01:21:42,739 --> 01:21:45,890
out of the Bush administration to run

2010
01:21:45,890 --> 01:21:48,080
cover for the fact that we were

2011
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:50,030
elevating a new kind of secret police

2012
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:55,489
across the country and what does it mean

2013
01:21:55,489 --> 01:21:59,719
when again in a democracy in the United

2014
01:21:59,719 --> 01:22:02,659
States the public is not partner to

2015
01:22:02,659 --> 01:22:04,580
government the public does not hold the

2016
01:22:04,580 --> 01:22:06,500
leash of government anymore but we are

2017
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:08,690
subject to government right we are

2018
01:22:08,690 --> 01:22:11,840
subordinate to government and we're not

2019
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:14,360
even allowed to know that it happened no

2020
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:17,510
not in in the book I tell the fact that

2021
01:22:17,510 --> 01:22:20,929
I had access to the unclassified version

2022
01:22:20,929 --> 01:22:25,250
of this report back in Japan and what's

2023
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:26,570
interesting is the unclassified version

2024
01:22:26,570 --> 01:22:28,340
of a report and we've all seen this

2025
01:22:28,340 --> 01:22:29,929
today with things like the Muller report

2026
01:22:29,929 --> 01:22:32,270
and all of the intelligence reporting

2027
01:22:32,270 --> 01:22:33,199
that's happened in the last several

2028
01:22:33,199 --> 01:22:36,350
years when the government provides a

2029
01:22:36,350 --> 01:22:38,239
classified report to the public it's

2030
01:22:38,239 --> 01:22:39,679
normally the same document the

2031
01:22:39,679 --> 01:22:41,630
unclassified version the classified

2032
01:22:41,630 --> 01:22:42,739
version are the same thing

2033
01:22:42,739 --> 01:22:44,690
just the unclassified version has things

2034
01:22:44,690 --> 01:22:47,270
blacked out or redacted that they say oh

2035
01:22:47,270 --> 01:22:48,650
you're not allowed to know this sentence

2036
01:22:48,650 --> 01:22:50,030
for this paragraph or this page or

2037
01:22:50,030 --> 01:22:53,060
whatever the document that the public

2038
01:22:53,060 --> 01:22:56,540
had been given about the warrantless

2039
01:22:56,540 --> 01:23:00,230
wiretapping program was a completely

2040
01:23:00,230 --> 01:23:03,429
different document it was a document

2041
01:23:03,429 --> 01:23:07,400
tailor-made to deceive and mislead the

2042
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:10,520
Congress and the public of the United

2043
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:12,650
States and it was effective in doing

2044
01:23:12,650 --> 01:23:17,440
that and in 2012 what I realized was

2045
01:23:17,949 --> 01:23:20,780
this is what real-world conspiracies

2046
01:23:20,780 --> 01:23:25,480
look like right it doesn't have to be

2047
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:28,520
smoking men behind closed doors right

2048
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:32,090
it's lawyers and politicians it's

2049
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:34,100
ordinary people from the working level

2050
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:35,870
to the management level

2051
01:23:35,870 --> 01:23:40,460
who go if we don't explain this in a

2052
01:23:40,460 --> 01:23:42,890
certain way we're all gonna lose our

2053
01:23:42,890 --> 01:23:48,110
jobs or the other way they go we're

2054
01:23:48,110 --> 01:23:49,250
gonna get something out of this if we

2055
01:23:49,250 --> 01:23:53,150
all work together civilization is the

2056
01:23:53,150 --> 01:23:55,220
history of conspiracy right what what is

2057
01:23:55,220 --> 01:23:56,960
civilization but a conspiracy for all

2058
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:58,940
all of us to do better by working

2059
01:23:58,940 --> 01:24:02,720
together right but it's this kind of

2060
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:06,110
thing that I think too often we forget

2061
01:24:06,110 --> 01:24:08,990
because it's boring as hell I want all

2062
01:24:08,990 --> 01:24:10,910
your listeners right to go to the

2063
01:24:10,910 --> 01:24:12,350
Washington Post because this document

2064
01:24:12,350 --> 01:24:13,730
that I discovered that that really

2065
01:24:13,730 --> 01:24:16,610
changed me has been published courtesy

2066
01:24:16,610 --> 01:24:17,540
of The Washington Post

2067
01:24:17,540 --> 01:24:19,730
it's called the the inspector general's

2068
01:24:19,730 --> 01:24:22,790
report on on stellar wind and you can

2069
01:24:22,790 --> 01:24:24,290
look at the actual document that I saw

2070
01:24:24,290 --> 01:24:27,260
that was unredacted right I had no

2071
01:24:27,260 --> 01:24:30,620
blacked-out pages on mine and what I

2072
01:24:30,620 --> 01:24:35,540
believe it shows is that some of the

2073
01:24:35,540 --> 01:24:36,680
most senior officials in the United

2074
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:41,690
States elected and unelected worked

2075
01:24:41,690 --> 01:24:45,140
together to actively undermine the

2076
01:24:45,140 --> 01:24:47,930
rights of the American people to give

2077
01:24:47,930 --> 01:24:53,000
themselves expanded powers now in their

2078
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,790
defense they said they were seeking

2079
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:57,500
these powers for a good and just and

2080
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:59,210
noble cause right they say they were

2081
01:24:59,210 --> 01:25:02,270
trying to keep us safe but that's what

2082
01:25:02,270 --> 01:25:03,680
they always say that's what every

2083
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:05,540
government says that's no different than

2084
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:06,920
what the Chinese government says or the

2085
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:11,090
Russian government says and the question

2086
01:25:11,090 --> 01:25:16,070
is if they are truly keeping us safe why

2087
01:25:16,070 --> 01:25:17,290
wouldn't they simply just tell us that

2088
01:25:17,290 --> 01:25:19,520
well why wouldn't they have that debate

2089
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:21,890
in Congress why wouldn't they put that

2090
01:25:21,890 --> 01:25:24,590
to a vote because if they were and they

2091
01:25:24,590 --> 01:25:29,000
could convince us that they were they'd

2092
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,580
win the vote and particularly we all

2093
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:33,620
know like the Patriot Act passed more

2094
01:25:33,620 --> 01:25:35,210
the worst pieces of legislation in

2095
01:25:35,210 --> 01:25:41,630
modern history passed why didn't we get

2096
01:25:41,630 --> 01:25:43,430
a vote and I think if you read the

2097
01:25:43,430 --> 01:25:45,380
report the answer we clear so I'm sorry

2098
01:25:45,380 --> 01:25:47,660
Joe I went on for various no is amazing

2099
01:25:47,660 --> 01:25:49,399
it's act don't don't apologize at all

2100
01:25:49,399 --> 01:25:51,949
it's just completely fascinating that

2101
01:25:51,949 --> 01:25:54,979
the continuation of this policy came

2102
01:25:54,979 --> 01:25:57,379
down to one man and the president having

2103
01:25:57,379 --> 01:26:02,179
this discussion that is so well it's

2104
01:26:02,179 --> 01:26:04,909
it's much it's much more much more but

2105
01:26:04,909 --> 01:26:07,099
right right literally the president at

2106
01:26:07,099 --> 01:26:09,649
the heart of it yes at the heart of it

2107
01:26:09,649 --> 01:26:13,219
in every expression of executive power

2108
01:26:13,219 --> 01:26:15,469
right and by executive we mean the White

2109
01:26:15,469 --> 01:26:19,999
House here the CIA the NSA the FBI

2110
01:26:19,999 --> 01:26:23,869
the DOJ right beat these guys exist as a

2111
01:26:23,869 --> 01:26:25,309
part of the executive branch of

2112
01:26:25,309 --> 01:26:28,159
government in a real way they work for

2113
01:26:28,159 --> 01:26:30,320
the White House now there are laws and

2114
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:32,119
regulations and policies that are

2115
01:26:32,119 --> 01:26:33,260
supposed to say they're supposed to do

2116
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:34,550
this and they're supposed to say they're

2117
01:26:34,550 --> 01:26:36,949
not supposed to do that but when you

2118
01:26:36,949 --> 01:26:38,329
look at federal regulations when you

2119
01:26:38,329 --> 01:26:39,860
look at policies as an employee of

2120
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:42,320
government when you violate these

2121
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:45,229
policies the worst thing that happens to

2122
01:26:45,229 --> 01:26:47,959
you is you lose your job because there's

2123
01:26:47,959 --> 01:26:50,329
no criminal penalty for the violation of

2124
01:26:50,329 --> 01:26:55,869
these laws and so it's very easy for

2125
01:26:55,869 --> 01:26:58,429
people who exist in these structures

2126
01:26:58,429 --> 01:27:00,649
particularly the very top levels of

2127
01:27:00,649 --> 01:27:02,749
these structures to go look we have a

2128
01:27:02,749 --> 01:27:05,149
given set of lawful authorities and

2129
01:27:05,149 --> 01:27:09,800
these are defined very broadly to give

2130
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:11,809
us leeway to do whatever it is we think

2131
01:27:11,809 --> 01:27:15,010
is proper and appropriate and just now

2132
01:27:15,010 --> 01:27:17,479
take that proper inappropriate and just

2133
01:27:17,479 --> 01:27:20,119
from the perspective of any given

2134
01:27:20,119 --> 01:27:23,629
individual Ryan any given president now

2135
01:27:23,629 --> 01:27:26,629
intersect that with what's good for them

2136
01:27:26,629 --> 01:27:30,699
politically and that's where problems

2137
01:27:30,699 --> 01:27:33,919
begin to arise now the safety measure

2138
01:27:33,919 --> 01:27:35,689
that's supposed to protect us from this

2139
01:27:35,689 --> 01:27:38,559
in the u.s. system in a democracy

2140
01:27:38,559 --> 01:27:41,599
broadly is these people are supposed to

2141
01:27:41,599 --> 01:27:44,149
be what are called public officials that

2142
01:27:44,149 --> 01:27:46,459
means we know their decisions that means

2143
01:27:46,459 --> 01:27:48,320
we know their policies that means we

2144
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:50,599
know their programs and prerogatives and

2145
01:27:50,599 --> 01:27:53,449
powers like what they are doing both in

2146
01:27:53,449 --> 01:27:56,269
our name and what they're doing against

2147
01:27:56,269 --> 01:27:59,419
us and because they are transparent to

2148
01:27:59,419 --> 01:28:00,050
us

2149
01:28:00,050 --> 01:28:02,630
we the people can then police their

2150
01:28:02,630 --> 01:28:03,889
activities we can go and disagree with

2151
01:28:03,889 --> 01:28:05,539
this we can protest it

2152
01:28:05,539 --> 01:28:07,579
we can't campaign against and write we

2153
01:28:07,579 --> 01:28:09,230
can try to become the president do

2154
01:28:09,230 --> 01:28:12,860
whatever they are public officials and

2155
01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:15,050
we are private citizens they're not

2156
01:28:15,050 --> 01:28:16,940
supposed to know anything about us right

2157
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:19,519
because we in relative terms hold no

2158
01:28:19,519 --> 01:28:21,860
power and they hold all the power so

2159
01:28:21,860 --> 01:28:23,030
they have to be under the tightest

2160
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:26,090
constraints we need to be in the freest

2161
01:28:26,090 --> 01:28:30,829
circumstances and yet the rise of the

2162
01:28:30,829 --> 01:28:32,719
state-secrets doctrine right this whole

2163
01:28:32,719 --> 01:28:35,030
classification system that goes all the

2164
01:28:35,030 --> 01:28:37,489
way back to last century about the

2165
01:28:37,489 --> 01:28:39,230
middle of the last century I believe is

2166
01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:40,579
is when it really started getting tested

2167
01:28:40,579 --> 01:28:42,769
in court and I think you know more about

2168
01:28:42,769 --> 01:28:45,440
this in many cases than I do when you

2169
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:50,900
start talking about what happened in the

2170
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:53,449
FBI and the CIA and the NSA is sort of

2171
01:28:53,449 --> 01:28:58,389
old dirty work in the the 20th century

2172
01:28:58,389 --> 01:29:03,019
is they abused their powers repeatedly

2173
01:29:03,019 --> 01:29:06,460
and continuously they did active harm to

2174
01:29:06,460 --> 01:29:08,599
domestic politics in the United States

2175
01:29:08,599 --> 01:29:10,659
the FBI was spying on Martin Luther King

2176
01:29:10,659 --> 01:29:13,280
and trying to get Martin Luther King to

2177
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:16,670
kill himself before the Nobel Prize was

2178
01:29:16,670 --> 01:29:20,599
going to be awarded in fact after MLK

2179
01:29:20,599 --> 01:29:24,260
gave his I have a dream speech two days

2180
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:27,199
later the FBI classified him is the

2181
01:29:27,199 --> 01:29:29,659
greatest national or I think it was the

2182
01:29:29,659 --> 01:29:32,179
greatest national security threat in the

2183
01:29:32,179 --> 01:29:35,239
United States and yet this is the FBI

2184
01:29:35,239 --> 01:29:37,400
this is the the group that everybody's

2185
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:38,960
applauding today saying all these these

2186
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:41,360
wonderful Patriots and heroes now I'm

2187
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:43,730
not saying everybody the FBI is bad

2188
01:29:43,730 --> 01:29:45,380
I'm not saying anybody everybody the CIA

2189
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:47,929
and the NSA is bad I'm saying that you

2190
01:29:47,929 --> 01:29:49,400
don't become patriot based on where you

2191
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:50,800
work

2192
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:54,349
patriotism is not about a loyalty to

2193
01:29:54,349 --> 01:29:59,059
government patriotism in fact it's not

2194
01:29:59,059 --> 01:30:03,110
about loyalty to anything patriotism is

2195
01:30:03,110 --> 01:30:06,619
a constant effort to do good for the P

2196
01:30:06,619 --> 01:30:09,380
of your country right it's not about the

2197
01:30:09,380 --> 01:30:13,460
government it's not about the state and

2198
01:30:13,460 --> 01:30:16,580
this is well we'll get into loyalty

2199
01:30:16,580 --> 01:30:18,619
later because you know I think one of

2200
01:30:18,619 --> 01:30:20,630
the big criticisms against me there

2201
01:30:20,630 --> 01:30:22,940
should be talked about is um they go

2202
01:30:22,940 --> 01:30:25,760
look this guy is disloyal he broke an

2203
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:31,670
oath he did whatever a loyalty loyalty

2204
01:30:31,670 --> 01:30:35,090
is a good thing when it's in the service

2205
01:30:35,090 --> 01:30:37,429
of something good but it is only good

2206
01:30:37,429 --> 01:30:38,960
when it's in the service of something

2207
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:41,389
good if you're loyal to a bad person if

2208
01:30:41,389 --> 01:30:43,190
you're loyal to a bad program if you're

2209
01:30:43,190 --> 01:30:44,869
loyal to a bad government

2210
01:30:44,869 --> 01:30:48,230
that loyalty is actively harmful and I

2211
01:30:48,230 --> 01:30:49,820
think that's overlooked but yeah when

2212
01:30:49,820 --> 01:30:52,119
you get back into this whole thing about

2213
01:30:52,119 --> 01:30:57,050
sort of where it came from why it

2214
01:30:57,050 --> 01:30:59,570
happened how it could come out of just

2215
01:30:59,570 --> 01:31:01,790
this small group and then they could

2216
01:31:01,790 --> 01:31:05,630
slowly kind of poison by implication by

2217
01:31:05,630 --> 01:31:08,090
complicity by bringing them into the

2218
01:31:08,090 --> 01:31:10,040
conspiracy and then having them not say

2219
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:11,869
anything about it a wider and wider

2220
01:31:11,869 --> 01:31:15,800
broad a body of people and then once

2221
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:17,690
you've got enough people in on it it's

2222
01:31:17,690 --> 01:31:18,800
much easier to convince other people

2223
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:20,510
that it's legitimate because they can go

2224
01:31:20,510 --> 01:31:22,550
look we've got 30 people who know about

2225
01:31:22,550 --> 01:31:24,830
this and none of them have objected to

2226
01:31:24,830 --> 01:31:28,010
it why are you gonna object to this all

2227
01:31:28,010 --> 01:31:30,699
of this derives from that original sin

2228
01:31:30,699 --> 01:31:35,840
which is in a democracy creating a

2229
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:39,260
system of government that is in fact a

2230
01:31:39,260 --> 01:31:41,239
secret government a body of secret law

2231
01:31:41,239 --> 01:31:45,260
body of secret policy that is far beyond

2232
01:31:45,260 --> 01:31:47,750
what legitimate government secrets could

2233
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:49,010
be this is not saying like government

2234
01:31:49,010 --> 01:31:51,949
hasn't can have no secrecy at all if the

2235
01:31:51,949 --> 01:31:53,830
government wants to investigate someone

2236
01:31:53,830 --> 01:31:56,420
without having them respond right we're

2237
01:31:56,420 --> 01:31:58,250
talking traditional law enforcement sure

2238
01:31:58,250 --> 01:31:59,869
you're not gonna tell this mobster hey

2239
01:31:59,869 --> 01:32:01,340
you know we're gonna start investigating

2240
01:32:01,340 --> 01:32:04,040
you we the public don't need to know the

2241
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:05,750
names of every terrorist suspect out in

2242
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:09,760
the world right but we do need to know

2243
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:12,409
again the powers and programs the

2244
01:32:12,409 --> 01:32:14,030
policies that a government is asserting

2245
01:32:14,030 --> 01:32:15,889
at least the broad outlines of it

2246
01:32:15,889 --> 01:32:17,360
because otherwise how can we control it

2247
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:19,760
how do we know if the government is a

2248
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:24,320
it's authorities that are supposed to be

2249
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:28,040
granted to it by us if we don't know

2250
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:30,500
what it is that they're doing and so

2251
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:32,420
this is the the main thing and really

2252
01:32:32,420 --> 01:32:34,370
the story behind the title permanent

2253
01:32:34,370 --> 01:32:39,380
record is look Joe when you were a kid

2254
01:32:39,380 --> 01:32:42,380
you know when I was a kid when you were

2255
01:32:42,380 --> 01:32:44,450
a teenager riling what's the worst thing

2256
01:32:44,450 --> 01:32:48,500
you've ever said you know did you say

2257
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:49,970
anything you weren't proud did you do

2258
01:32:49,970 --> 01:32:51,230
anything that you weren't proud of

2259
01:32:51,230 --> 01:32:54,230
something that today in like the whoa

2260
01:32:54,230 --> 01:32:56,450
kissed of Twitter land you would get in

2261
01:32:56,450 --> 01:32:59,720
trouble for I'm sure and that's one of

2262
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:01,370
the horrible things about kids growing

2263
01:33:01,370 --> 01:33:03,680
up today is that they do have all this

2264
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:05,600
stuff out there on social media forever

2265
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:08,540
and they can be judged horribly by

2266
01:33:08,540 --> 01:33:10,750
something they did when they were 13

2267
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:17,120
it's exactly that our worst mistakes our

2268
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:21,620
deepest shames were forgotten right they

2269
01:33:21,620 --> 01:33:24,200
were lost they were ephemeral even the

2270
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:25,700
things we did get caught for they were

2271
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:27,800
known for a time maybe they're still

2272
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:29,480
remembered by people who are closest to

2273
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:31,750
us whether we like them or dislike them

2274
01:33:31,750 --> 01:33:35,080
but they were people connected to us now

2275
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:38,540
we're forced to live in a real way naked

2276
01:33:38,540 --> 01:33:41,180
before power whether we're talking about

2277
01:33:41,180 --> 01:33:43,190
Facebook whether we're talking about

2278
01:33:43,190 --> 01:33:45,110
Google whether we're talking about the

2279
01:33:45,110 --> 01:33:48,110
government of any country they know

2280
01:33:48,110 --> 01:33:51,740
everything about us or much about us

2281
01:33:51,740 --> 01:33:54,380
rather and we know very little about

2282
01:33:54,380 --> 01:33:56,420
them and we're not allowed to know more

2283
01:33:56,420 --> 01:33:59,330
everything that we do now lasts forever

2284
01:33:59,330 --> 01:34:03,530
not because we want to remember but

2285
01:34:03,530 --> 01:34:06,500
because we're not allowed to forget just

2286
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:07,880
carrying a phone in your pocket is

2287
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:09,860
enough for your movements to be

2288
01:34:09,860 --> 01:34:12,020
memorialized because every cell phone

2289
01:34:12,020 --> 01:34:14,150
tower that you pass is keeping a record

2290
01:34:14,150 --> 01:34:17,780
of that and 18t keeps those records

2291
01:34:17,780 --> 01:34:21,170
going back to 2008 under program called

2292
01:34:21,170 --> 01:34:23,270
Hemisphere if you search for Hemisphere

2293
01:34:23,270 --> 01:34:25,400
and AT&T you'll get a story in The Daily

2294
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:27,680
Beast about it 18 he keeps your phone

2295
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:31,210
records going back to 1983

2296
01:34:31,210 --> 01:34:33,360
if any year listeners were born after

2297
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:36,010
1983 right born after me or it might be

2298
01:34:36,010 --> 01:34:39,550
1987 excuse me 1987 if they're born

2299
01:34:39,550 --> 01:34:42,429
after 1987 and they're 18 is he customer

2300
01:34:42,429 --> 01:34:44,620
or their calls cross 18 days network

2301
01:34:44,620 --> 01:34:46,420
ATMs he has every phone call they ever

2302
01:34:46,420 --> 01:34:49,120
made rather the record that had happened

2303
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:50,830
not necessarily the contents on the

2304
01:34:50,830 --> 01:34:53,500
phone call um and so I mean let me turn

2305
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:55,000
this around for you Joe cuz I feel like

2306
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:58,620
I've just been given a given of speech

2307
01:34:58,620 --> 01:35:01,780
when you look at this stuff right when

2308
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:03,880
you look at what's happening with

2309
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:05,679
government when you look at what's

2310
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:08,170
happening with the Trump White House the

2311
01:35:08,170 --> 01:35:09,760
Obama White House the Bush White House

2312
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:12,489
you could see this trend happening when

2313
01:35:12,489 --> 01:35:13,239
you look at what's happening with

2314
01:35:13,239 --> 01:35:14,500
Facebook when you look at what's

2315
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:16,120
happening with Google when you look the

2316
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:18,070
fact that you go to every restaurant

2317
01:35:18,070 --> 01:35:20,230
today and you see people look at the

2318
01:35:20,230 --> 01:35:22,390
phones you know you get on a bus you get

2319
01:35:22,390 --> 01:35:24,400
on a subway you know you see somebody

2320
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:26,290
sitting next to you in traffic you see

2321
01:35:26,290 --> 01:35:29,290
people looking at phones these devices

2322
01:35:29,290 --> 01:35:31,480
are connected all the time now people

2323
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:33,130
are getting Alexa right now now people

2324
01:35:33,130 --> 01:35:35,949
have okay Google they have you know Siri

2325
01:35:35,949 --> 01:35:37,330
on their phones that are in their house

2326
01:35:37,330 --> 01:35:39,159
they've always got these connected

2327
01:35:39,159 --> 01:35:42,520
microphones where do you think this

2328
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:46,420
leads and what is it that gives you sort

2329
01:35:46,420 --> 01:35:47,920
of trust in the system faith in the

2330
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:51,100
system like how just-just-just so we can

2331
01:35:51,100 --> 01:35:53,500
start a conversation here what strikes

2332
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:56,230
you about this well it's completely

2333
01:35:56,230 --> 01:35:59,140
alien and it's new this is something

2334
01:35:59,140 --> 01:36:01,030
that's unprecedented we don't have a

2335
01:36:01,030 --> 01:36:03,969
long human history of being completely

2336
01:36:03,969 --> 01:36:05,980
connected via technology this is

2337
01:36:05,980 --> 01:36:07,600
something we're navigating right now for

2338
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:10,360
the first time and it's probably the

2339
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:13,840
most powerful thing that the human race

2340
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:15,310
has ever seen in terms of the

2341
01:36:15,310 --> 01:36:16,719
distribution of information there's

2342
01:36:16,719 --> 01:36:19,540
nothing that even comes close to it in

2343
01:36:19,540 --> 01:36:21,250
all of human history and we're figuring

2344
01:36:21,250 --> 01:36:22,750
it out as we go along

2345
01:36:22,750 --> 01:36:26,650
and what you exposed is that not only

2346
01:36:26,650 --> 01:36:29,409
are we figuring out as we go along but

2347
01:36:29,409 --> 01:36:31,780
that to cover their ass

2348
01:36:31,780 --> 01:36:33,940
these cellphone companies in cahoots

2349
01:36:33,940 --> 01:36:35,679
with the government have made it legal

2350
01:36:35,679 --> 01:36:38,890
for them to gather up all of your phone

2351
01:36:38,890 --> 01:36:41,230
calls all of your text messages all of

2352
01:36:41,230 --> 01:36:44,190
your emails and store them somewhere so

2353
01:36:44,190 --> 01:36:46,290
that retroactive Lee if you ever say

2354
01:36:46,290 --> 01:36:48,000
anything they don't like or do something

2355
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,670
they don't like they can go back find

2356
01:36:50,670 --> 01:36:53,130
that and use it against you and we don't

2357
01:36:53,130 --> 01:36:54,690
know who they are we don't know why

2358
01:36:54,690 --> 01:36:56,100
they're doing it and we didn't know they

2359
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:59,220
could do it until you exposed it the the

2360
01:36:59,220 --> 01:37:00,720
connection of human beings via

2361
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:03,960
technology is is both amazing and

2362
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:06,360
powerful and incredible in terms of our

2363
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:09,840
access to knowledge but terrifying in

2364
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:12,750
terms of the government's ability to

2365
01:37:12,750 --> 01:37:15,120
track our movements track your phone

2366
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:17,010
calls track everything and under the

2367
01:37:17,010 --> 01:37:19,080
guise of protecting us from terrorists

2368
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:21,060
and protecting us from sleeper cells

2369
01:37:21,060 --> 01:37:23,220
protecting us from attacks look if they

2370
01:37:23,220 --> 01:37:25,200
really are attacked protecting us from

2371
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:28,670
these attacks that's great but there's

2372
01:37:28,670 --> 01:37:32,280
there's no provision in the Constitution

2373
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:35,220
that allows any of this and this is

2374
01:37:35,220 --> 01:37:36,930
where it gets really squirrely because

2375
01:37:36,930 --> 01:37:38,940
they're making up the rules as they go

2376
01:37:38,940 --> 01:37:40,980
along and they're making up these rules

2377
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:42,840
the way you're describing it this is

2378
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:45,240
step by step this has happened to sort

2379
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:47,070
of protect their ass and keep themselves

2380
01:37:47,070 --> 01:37:50,370
from being implicated in what has been a

2381
01:37:50,370 --> 01:37:52,110
violation of our rights and our

2382
01:37:52,110 --> 01:37:55,140
privacy's and the Fourth Amendment yeah

2383
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:57,510
I mean I I think I think one of the

2384
01:37:57,510 --> 01:38:00,990
things that everybody needs to

2385
01:38:00,990 --> 01:38:04,070
understand when you look at these things

2386
01:38:04,070 --> 01:38:06,570
and the reason you know we talked about

2387
01:38:06,570 --> 01:38:08,760
before when I got this information why I

2388
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:09,960
didn't just put it on the internet and

2389
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:11,640
people criticize me for this they go I

2390
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:14,280
didn't share enough information because

2391
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:16,020
the journalists are gatekeeping right

2392
01:38:16,020 --> 01:38:17,580
they've got a big archive and they

2393
01:38:17,580 --> 01:38:18,870
haven't published everything from it and

2394
01:38:18,870 --> 01:38:20,730
I told them not to publish everything

2395
01:38:20,730 --> 01:38:23,540
why did you do that why did you do that

2396
01:38:23,540 --> 01:38:26,760
because so again I get back to

2397
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:28,020
legitimate secrets an illegitimate

2398
01:38:28,020 --> 01:38:32,610
secrets um some spying from my

2399
01:38:32,610 --> 01:38:35,250
perspective you know career spy is okay

2400
01:38:35,250 --> 01:38:35,910
right

2401
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:38,430
agreed if you have hacked a terrorists

2402
01:38:38,430 --> 01:38:39,930
phone right and you're getting some

2403
01:38:39,930 --> 01:38:41,580
information about that useful agreed

2404
01:38:41,580 --> 01:38:45,090
yeah if you're spying on a Russian

2405
01:38:45,090 --> 01:38:46,890
general in charge of a you know rocket

2406
01:38:46,890 --> 01:38:51,450
division useful right but there there

2407
01:38:51,450 --> 01:38:53,970
are lines and degrees in that where it's

2408
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:57,090
not useful now the examples that I just

2409
01:38:57,090 --> 01:38:58,110
gave you these are

2410
01:38:58,110 --> 01:38:59,880
targeted this is where you're spying on

2411
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:03,300
an individual there no named person that

2412
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:05,310
is being monitored for a specific reason

2413
01:39:05,310 --> 01:39:07,949
that is related hopefully from a warrant

2414
01:39:07,949 --> 01:39:11,250
people write well even for foreign

2415
01:39:11,250 --> 01:39:13,590
intelligence and some indications you

2416
01:39:13,590 --> 01:39:15,600
don't need a warrant

2417
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:17,639
strictly although I think they should

2418
01:39:17,639 --> 01:39:18,750
have warrants for all of these

2419
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:20,610
investigations because they established

2420
01:39:20,610 --> 01:39:23,219
a court for precisely this reason called

2421
01:39:23,219 --> 01:39:24,239
the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance

2422
01:39:24,239 --> 01:39:26,790
Court right yeah and there's not a judge

2423
01:39:26,790 --> 01:39:28,860
in the world who wouldn't stamp a

2424
01:39:28,860 --> 01:39:32,369
warrant saying hey spy on Abu jihad over

2425
01:39:32,369 --> 01:39:36,619
here right and if you want to spy on

2426
01:39:36,619 --> 01:39:40,139
another guy Boris badenov with the

2427
01:39:40,139 --> 01:39:42,060
rocket division right that that's okay

2428
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:46,320
they're gonna go with that but then you

2429
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:49,590
look at these edge cases and in the

2430
01:39:49,590 --> 01:39:51,600
archive that I provided to journalists

2431
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:52,560
that meant stories that have come down

2432
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:54,840
where they've spied on journalists right

2433
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:57,150
they've spied on human rights groups and

2434
01:39:57,150 --> 01:40:01,440
these kind of things I think people miss

2435
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:04,020
I'm gonna throw up some slides here so

2436
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:06,510
forgive me if this gets weird and I put

2437
01:40:06,510 --> 01:40:09,600
up the wrong ones but since I came

2438
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:12,170
forward this Foreign Intelligence

2439
01:40:12,170 --> 01:40:14,460
Surveillance Court that the government

2440
01:40:14,460 --> 01:40:17,580
says authorized these programs 15

2441
01:40:17,580 --> 01:40:21,389
different times was overruled by the

2442
01:40:21,389 --> 01:40:23,429
first open courts to look at the program

2443
01:40:23,429 --> 01:40:25,199
these are federal courts here right that

2444
01:40:25,199 --> 01:40:26,969
said no actually these programs are

2445
01:40:26,969 --> 01:40:29,190
unlawful they're likely unconstitutional

2446
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:31,920
when you start looking at the facts you

2447
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:34,260
see even within the context of the very

2448
01:40:34,260 --> 01:40:36,449
loose restrictions and laws that apply

2449
01:40:36,449 --> 01:40:38,850
to the NSA and surveillance they say

2450
01:40:38,850 --> 01:40:42,210
they broke their own laws you know two

2451
01:40:42,210 --> 01:40:44,219
thousand seven hundred and seventy six

2452
01:40:44,219 --> 01:40:46,830
times in a single year and then you

2453
01:40:46,830 --> 01:40:48,330
asked about that thing that motivates me

2454
01:40:48,330 --> 01:40:52,469
like why I came forward we had been

2455
01:40:52,469 --> 01:40:56,159
trying as a country before I came

2456
01:40:56,159 --> 01:40:59,070
forward to prove the existence of these

2457
01:40:59,070 --> 01:41:02,670
programs legally because this is our

2458
01:41:02,670 --> 01:41:05,940
this is our means of last sort of

2459
01:41:05,940 --> 01:41:09,150
recourse in our system right we get the

2460
01:41:09,150 --> 01:41:11,969
executive we got the legislature we got

2461
01:41:11,969 --> 01:41:15,400
right so Congress makes the laws the

2462
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:16,600
executives supposed to carry them out

2463
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:19,170
the courts are supposed to play referee

2464
01:41:19,170 --> 01:41:22,920
the executive had broken the laws

2465
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:25,510
Congress was turning a blind eye to the

2466
01:41:25,510 --> 01:41:29,110
laws and the courts were and this is

2467
01:41:29,110 --> 01:41:31,719
just months before I came forward going

2468
01:41:31,719 --> 01:41:36,760
well it does appear that the ACLU and

2469
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:40,890
Amnesty International like all of these

2470
01:41:40,890 --> 01:41:43,390
human rights groups and non-governmental

2471
01:41:43,390 --> 01:41:46,870
organizations had established that you

2472
01:41:46,870 --> 01:41:50,230
know these programs are likely unlawful

2473
01:41:50,230 --> 01:41:53,920
they likely exist they're simply

2474
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:55,750
classified but the government responded

2475
01:41:55,750 --> 01:41:58,110
with this argument that you just saw

2476
01:41:58,110 --> 01:42:01,270
saying that well it's a state secret if

2477
01:42:01,270 --> 01:42:03,910
they do exist you the plaintiffs don't

2478
01:42:03,910 --> 01:42:06,910
have hard concrete evidence that they do

2479
01:42:06,910 --> 01:42:09,100
exist and the government is saying

2480
01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:12,040
legally you have no right to discover

2481
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:13,480
evidence from the government right

2482
01:42:13,480 --> 01:42:15,100
documents demand documents or demand an

2483
01:42:15,100 --> 01:42:16,210
answer from the government as to whether

2484
01:42:16,210 --> 01:42:19,449
things these as to whether or not these

2485
01:42:19,449 --> 01:42:21,489
things exist because the government's

2486
01:42:21,489 --> 01:42:23,410
just gonna give its standard what they

2487
01:42:23,410 --> 01:42:24,880
called Glomar response we can neither

2488
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:27,690
confirm nor deny that these things exist

2489
01:42:27,690 --> 01:42:30,400
which leaves you out in the cold which

2490
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:31,960
leaves the courts out in the cold the

2491
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:34,989
courts go look the government could be

2492
01:42:34,989 --> 01:42:36,760
breaking along here look they could be

2493
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:38,020
violating the Constitution here but

2494
01:42:38,020 --> 01:42:41,350
because you can't prove it and because

2495
01:42:41,350 --> 01:42:42,550
the government doesn't wanna play ball

2496
01:42:42,550 --> 01:42:46,810
and the government says if we were doing

2497
01:42:46,810 --> 01:42:49,750
this it would be legal and it would be

2498
01:42:49,750 --> 01:42:51,340
necessary for national security or

2499
01:42:51,340 --> 01:42:54,429
whatever the court can't presume to know

2500
01:42:54,429 --> 01:42:56,350
national security better than the

2501
01:42:56,350 --> 01:42:58,120
executive because the courts aren't

2502
01:42:58,120 --> 01:43:01,330
elected and so this leads to this

2503
01:43:01,330 --> 01:43:03,219
fundamentally broken system where okay

2504
01:43:03,219 --> 01:43:05,170
if the only way to have the courts

2505
01:43:05,170 --> 01:43:07,989
review the legality of the programs is

2506
01:43:07,989 --> 01:43:11,050
to establish the programs exist but the

2507
01:43:11,050 --> 01:43:12,940
programs are classified so you can't

2508
01:43:12,940 --> 01:43:15,100
establish they exist unless you have

2509
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:17,650
evidence but providing that evidence to

2510
01:43:17,650 --> 01:43:21,730
courts to journalists to anyone is a

2511
01:43:21,730 --> 01:43:24,010
felony right that's punishable by 10

2512
01:43:24,010 --> 01:43:24,960
years per count

2513
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:27,420
the Espionage Act and the government has

2514
01:43:27,420 --> 01:43:30,390
charged every a source of Public

2515
01:43:30,390 --> 01:43:32,640
Interest journalism who's really made a

2516
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:33,989
significant difference in these kind of

2517
01:43:33,989 --> 01:43:37,110
cases since Daniel Ellsberg really going

2518
01:43:37,110 --> 01:43:39,450
back to that under the same Espionage

2519
01:43:39,450 --> 01:43:41,520
Act it's always the same law and this is

2520
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:43,770
there's no distinction to government

2521
01:43:43,770 --> 01:43:45,480
between whether you've sold information

2522
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:47,580
to a foreign government for private

2523
01:43:47,580 --> 01:43:51,840
benefit right or whether you provide an

2524
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:54,450
information only to journalists for the

2525
01:43:54,450 --> 01:43:56,760
public interest and then that's a

2526
01:43:56,760 --> 01:44:00,840
fundamentally harmful thing I think when

2527
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:04,830
you look at things that have come in the

2528
01:44:04,830 --> 01:44:06,150
wake of this we're talking about the the

2529
01:44:06,150 --> 01:44:09,690
post 2013 court rulings that found what

2530
01:44:09,690 --> 01:44:12,290
the government was doing was unlawful

2531
01:44:12,290 --> 01:44:15,330
you see the courts saying actually that

2532
01:44:15,330 --> 01:44:20,250
leaks or air quotes leaks can actually

2533
01:44:20,250 --> 01:44:24,719
be beneficial leak is used in the

2534
01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:25,980
government's and this you know this is

2535
01:44:25,980 --> 01:44:27,239
from a federal court these are not

2536
01:44:27,239 --> 01:44:29,340
exactly my biggest supporters they are

2537
01:44:29,340 --> 01:44:32,340
recognizing that although leak implies

2538
01:44:32,340 --> 01:44:34,380
harm it implies something that's broken

2539
01:44:34,380 --> 01:44:36,480
it's actually helpful it's a leak that's

2540
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:39,840
letting in daylight in this context that

2541
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:44,550
is the only thing that allows the system

2542
01:44:44,550 --> 01:44:48,300
to operate in a context where one year

2543
01:44:48,300 --> 01:44:49,650
before I came forward

2544
01:44:49,650 --> 01:44:51,870
we had the NSA saying this kind of stuff

2545
01:44:51,870 --> 01:44:53,430
didn't happen

2546
01:44:53,430 --> 01:44:57,690
we had hang on this famous exchange

2547
01:44:57,690 --> 01:44:58,980
which more than anything

2548
01:44:58,980 --> 01:45:00,780
made me realize this was a point of no

2549
01:45:00,780 --> 01:45:02,310
return because I've told you this you've

2550
01:45:02,310 --> 01:45:06,260
heard this but if you haven't seen it

2551
01:45:06,260 --> 01:45:09,000
you might not believe me right maybe I'm

2552
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,640
a sketchy guy whatever one of those

2553
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:13,140
senators I told you that objected to

2554
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:14,580
this stuff that was doing the lassie

2555
01:45:14,580 --> 01:45:15,960
barks for all those years

2556
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:19,230
Ron Wyden was confronting the most

2557
01:45:19,230 --> 01:45:21,330
senior spy in the United States a

2558
01:45:21,330 --> 01:45:24,300
General James clapper who was then the

2559
01:45:24,300 --> 01:45:26,120
Director of National Intelligence right

2560
01:45:26,120 --> 01:45:29,310
there's no guy higher than him the buck

2561
01:45:29,310 --> 01:45:30,390
stops with him when it comes to

2562
01:45:30,390 --> 01:45:33,150
intelligence he's testifying under oath

2563
01:45:33,150 --> 01:45:35,550
in front of Congress right but more

2564
01:45:35,550 --> 01:45:36,960
broadly in front of the

2565
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:39,300
public this is televised and ron wyden

2566
01:45:39,300 --> 01:45:41,160
asked him a very specific question about

2567
01:45:41,160 --> 01:45:44,540
a program mind you that ron wyden knows

2568
01:45:44,540 --> 01:45:46,920
exists because he has security clearance

2569
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:48,560
he sits on the Intelligence Committee

2570
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:50,790
and he knows there's domestic mass

2571
01:45:50,790 --> 01:45:52,260
surveillance and this is how it goes

2572
01:45:52,260 --> 01:45:54,060
this is how the top spy responds under

2573
01:45:54,060 --> 01:46:00,900
oath so what I wanted to see is if you

2574
01:46:00,900 --> 01:46:02,700
could give me a yes or no answer to the

2575
01:46:02,700 --> 01:46:05,969
question does the NSA collect any type

2576
01:46:05,969 --> 01:46:09,870
of data at all on millions or hundreds

2577
01:46:09,870 --> 01:46:14,730
of millions of Americans no sir it does

2578
01:46:14,730 --> 01:46:16,219
not

2579
01:46:16,219 --> 01:46:20,400
not wittingly there are cases where they

2580
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:24,300
could inadvertently perhaps collect but

2581
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:31,680
not not wittingly so that was a lie

2582
01:46:31,680 --> 01:46:34,350
Wyden knew it was a lie clapper knew it

2583
01:46:34,350 --> 01:46:36,570
was a lie he actually admitted it was a

2584
01:46:36,570 --> 01:46:39,540
lie after I came forward you know three

2585
01:46:39,540 --> 01:46:42,810
months later but he said it was the

2586
01:46:42,810 --> 01:46:45,690
least untruthful thing he could think of

2587
01:46:45,690 --> 01:46:48,270
to say in the context of being in the

2588
01:46:48,270 --> 01:46:51,840
hot seat there but what does it mean for

2589
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:53,370
a democracy when you can lie under oath

2590
01:46:53,370 --> 01:46:55,050
to Congress and the congressman even

2591
01:46:55,050 --> 01:46:57,510
knows you're lying to them but they're

2592
01:46:57,510 --> 01:47:00,750
afraid to correct you and widened by the

2593
01:47:00,750 --> 01:47:02,520
way it wasn't a surprise Wyden gave him

2594
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:03,810
those questions twenty-four hours in

2595
01:47:03,810 --> 01:47:06,780
advance and he wrote a letter afterwards

2596
01:47:06,780 --> 01:47:08,640
asking for clapper to amend his

2597
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:10,650
testimony right now not even at a press

2598
01:47:10,650 --> 01:47:12,630
conference but just to say this was

2599
01:47:12,630 --> 01:47:15,030
incorrect whatever so he could go

2600
01:47:15,030 --> 01:47:16,860
through the legal process and show his

2601
01:47:16,860 --> 01:47:19,200
fellow congressmen that there was a

2602
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:21,030
problem and they needed to do it but all

2603
01:47:21,030 --> 01:47:23,330
of that was refused to us all of it was

2604
01:47:23,330 --> 01:47:26,850
denied to us and Here I am sitting at

2605
01:47:26,850 --> 01:47:29,190
the NSA next to my buddies who I've

2606
01:47:29,190 --> 01:47:31,410
talked to about these programs you know

2607
01:47:31,410 --> 01:47:33,930
I've gone look at this and they're

2608
01:47:33,930 --> 01:47:36,030
laughing at it you know I'm laughing at

2609
01:47:36,030 --> 01:47:37,620
it and it's not it's not that we go oh

2610
01:47:37,620 --> 01:47:40,050
ha ha ha he's getting away with it it's

2611
01:47:40,050 --> 01:47:41,790
like what are you gonna do these guys

2612
01:47:41,790 --> 01:47:42,780
are you know they're they're

2613
01:47:42,780 --> 01:47:45,980
bullshitters that the system is built

2614
01:47:45,980 --> 01:47:47,380
online

2615
01:47:47,380 --> 01:47:50,620
that even many people many experts who

2616
01:47:50,620 --> 01:47:53,890
have studied this know are lies but if

2617
01:47:53,890 --> 01:47:57,430
you can't prove their lies how do you

2618
01:47:57,430 --> 01:47:59,530
move beyond that and that's really a

2619
01:47:59,530 --> 01:48:00,850
question that has never been more

2620
01:48:00,850 --> 01:48:03,430
relevant than I think it is today under

2621
01:48:03,430 --> 01:48:06,520
the current White House so you're in

2622
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:07,900
this position where you have this

2623
01:48:07,900 --> 01:48:10,650
information and you know that these

2624
01:48:10,650 --> 01:48:13,270
surveillance systems are in place and

2625
01:48:13,270 --> 01:48:15,850
they're unconstitutional and you feel

2626
01:48:15,850 --> 01:48:17,920
this deep responsibility to let the

2627
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:20,350
American people know about this what

2628
01:48:20,350 --> 01:48:26,910
what makes you take the leap so this is

2629
01:48:26,910 --> 01:48:32,320
covered extensively in the book because

2630
01:48:32,320 --> 01:48:34,120
it took a long time I would imagine

2631
01:48:34,120 --> 01:48:37,270
people people you know yeah right

2632
01:48:37,270 --> 01:48:39,370
exactly people like to think it's like a

2633
01:48:39,370 --> 01:48:43,120
cinematic moment where I find this

2634
01:48:43,120 --> 01:48:44,530
golden document like this stellar wind

2635
01:48:44,530 --> 01:48:46,540
report and that's the closest thing to a

2636
01:48:46,540 --> 01:48:51,160
smoking gun right that exists but look

2637
01:48:51,160 --> 01:48:52,690
if you found that you you can read that

2638
01:48:52,690 --> 01:48:54,100
later look at that and like imagine

2639
01:48:54,100 --> 01:48:55,780
yourself being like oh I'm gonna go

2640
01:48:55,780 --> 01:48:57,460
outside on the courthouse steps and wave

2641
01:48:57,460 --> 01:48:59,140
this thing burn my life to the ground

2642
01:48:59,140 --> 01:49:00,640
burn my family to the ground I'm never

2643
01:49:00,640 --> 01:49:03,160
going to be work again I'm going to jail

2644
01:49:03,160 --> 01:49:07,300
for the rest of my life the question is

2645
01:49:07,300 --> 01:49:09,160
what would it take for you to light a

2646
01:49:09,160 --> 01:49:12,300
match and burn your life to the ground

2647
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:21,600
too long the answer was nothing and I'm

2648
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:29,040
ashamed of that it took me so long to

2649
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:31,030
get over that home because I was waiting

2650
01:49:31,030 --> 01:49:33,570
for somebody else to do it when I saw

2651
01:49:33,570 --> 01:49:37,390
people like Ron Wyden on this when I saw

2652
01:49:37,390 --> 01:49:38,950
people like the court case that I showed

2653
01:49:38,950 --> 01:49:40,300
before where people were actively

2654
01:49:40,300 --> 01:49:41,640
challenging these programs right

2655
01:49:41,640 --> 01:49:45,310
journalists had the scent of it and you

2656
01:49:45,310 --> 01:49:46,750
know there are a lot of people who are

2657
01:49:46,750 --> 01:49:48,880
gonna be in the you knows of the YouTube

2658
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:50,440
comments or whatever go oh I knew this

2659
01:49:50,440 --> 01:49:52,450
was happening no you didn't well Bill

2660
01:49:52,450 --> 01:49:55,750
bimini you had he bill Binney he built

2661
01:49:55,750 --> 01:49:57,850
built excuse me bill Binney he initially

2662
01:49:57,850 --> 01:50:00,490
was the one that came out and spoke

2663
01:50:00,490 --> 01:50:01,090
about

2664
01:50:01,090 --> 01:50:06,909
this issue and so yeah bill Benny is a

2665
01:50:06,909 --> 01:50:09,190
part of shall we say the group of early

2666
01:50:09,190 --> 01:50:11,170
NSA whistleblowers who came with Thomas

2667
01:50:11,170 --> 01:50:14,290
Drake bill Benny Kirk Wiebe I believe in

2668
01:50:14,290 --> 01:50:16,929
Edie Loomis and these guys all got their

2669
01:50:16,929 --> 01:50:18,699
doors kicked and you know they got

2670
01:50:18,699 --> 01:50:22,360
harassed by the FBI Tom Drake who was a

2671
01:50:22,360 --> 01:50:24,159
senior executive at the NSA this is a

2672
01:50:24,159 --> 01:50:26,710
guy who had a lot to lose was charged

2673
01:50:26,710 --> 01:50:28,449
under the same law was the Espionage Act

2674
01:50:28,449 --> 01:50:30,159
and these guys were doing it earlier

2675
01:50:30,159 --> 01:50:32,349
during the Bush administration some of

2676
01:50:32,349 --> 01:50:34,000
them were talking to the journalists

2677
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,340
that in you know maybe it's alleged I

2678
01:50:36,340 --> 01:50:37,540
don't want to put them on the spot maybe

2679
01:50:37,540 --> 01:50:40,030
they deny it maybe they don't leave that

2680
01:50:40,030 --> 01:50:44,889
to them but somebody somewhere was

2681
01:50:44,889 --> 01:50:46,929
informing this reporting right that got

2682
01:50:46,929 --> 01:50:48,310
into the New York Times about the Bush

2683
01:50:48,310 --> 01:50:50,469
era warrantless wiretapping program and

2684
01:50:50,469 --> 01:50:51,639
eventually journalists put this out

2685
01:50:51,639 --> 01:50:53,290
there people knew these capabilities

2686
01:50:53,290 --> 01:50:56,980
existed but yeah then there's the person

2687
01:50:56,980 --> 01:50:58,090
in the YouTube comments so it's like oh

2688
01:50:58,090 --> 01:50:59,530
we knew all about this is nothing new

2689
01:50:59,530 --> 01:51:01,480
and the thing is you can know about some

2690
01:51:01,480 --> 01:51:03,429
programs and not know about others you

2691
01:51:03,429 --> 01:51:05,619
can have a suspicion you can know with a

2692
01:51:05,619 --> 01:51:07,449
certainty that this stuff is capable or

2693
01:51:07,449 --> 01:51:10,150
it is possible to capability exists you

2694
01:51:10,150 --> 01:51:11,260
can know that the government has done

2695
01:51:11,260 --> 01:51:12,760
this stuff in the past you can know they

2696
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:14,590
are likely to do it again you can have

2697
01:51:14,590 --> 01:51:16,810
all these indications you can have like

2698
01:51:16,810 --> 01:51:20,020
the jewel versus NSA case that's run by

2699
01:51:20,020 --> 01:51:22,810
the e FF which is about the eighteen or

2700
01:51:22,810 --> 01:51:24,270
it's about AT&T

2701
01:51:24,270 --> 01:51:28,020
setting up secret rooms in their

2702
01:51:28,020 --> 01:51:30,219
telecommunications facilities where they

2703
01:51:30,219 --> 01:51:33,520
basically drag all the fibers for their

2704
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:36,070
domestic Internet communications and

2705
01:51:36,070 --> 01:51:38,590
like phone communications into a room

2706
01:51:38,590 --> 01:51:40,510
that's purpose-built for the NSA and

2707
01:51:40,510 --> 01:51:43,659
then they bring it out but AT&T Nuys

2708
01:51:43,659 --> 01:51:47,349
it's the NSA the NSA denies that these

2709
01:51:47,349 --> 01:51:49,480
things happen or that are done at all

2710
01:51:49,480 --> 01:51:53,020
right and so this is the context I you

2711
01:51:53,020 --> 01:51:55,300
say you know and you know let's put it

2712
01:51:55,300 --> 01:51:56,889
the other way maybe you do know right

2713
01:51:56,889 --> 01:51:59,110
maybe you are an academic researcher

2714
01:51:59,110 --> 01:52:02,050
maybe your technological specialist

2715
01:52:02,050 --> 01:52:04,719
maybe you're just somebody who reads all

2716
01:52:04,719 --> 01:52:07,389
the reporting and you actually know you

2717
01:52:07,389 --> 01:52:09,219
can't prove it but you know this is

2718
01:52:09,219 --> 01:52:11,110
going on but that's the thing in a

2719
01:52:11,110 --> 01:52:14,090
democracy the distance

2720
01:52:14,090 --> 01:52:16,820
between speculation and fact the

2721
01:52:16,820 --> 01:52:19,580
distance between what you know and what

2722
01:52:19,580 --> 01:52:21,380
you can prove to everybody else in the

2723
01:52:21,380 --> 01:52:24,440
country is everything in our model of

2724
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:26,690
government because what you know doesn't

2725
01:52:26,690 --> 01:52:29,900
matter what matters is what we all know

2726
01:52:29,900 --> 01:52:31,490
and the only way we can all know it is

2727
01:52:31,490 --> 01:52:32,990
if somebody can prove it if you can

2728
01:52:32,990 --> 01:52:33,980
prove it and if you don't have the

2729
01:52:33,980 --> 01:52:36,140
evidence you can't prove it and of

2730
01:52:36,140 --> 01:52:37,430
course when we talk about the earlier

2731
01:52:37,430 --> 01:52:39,290
stuff right like this or more

2732
01:52:39,290 --> 01:52:41,870
corporatized media they've got a

2733
01:52:41,870 --> 01:52:44,480
thousand incentives not to get involved

2734
01:52:44,480 --> 01:52:46,250
in this stuff they need access to the

2735
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:47,900
White House they need these officials to

2736
01:52:47,900 --> 01:52:49,760
sit down with them and give interviews

2737
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:51,950
right that's constant content that they

2738
01:52:51,950 --> 01:52:54,020
need that's access that they need they

2739
01:52:54,020 --> 01:52:55,790
need to be taken seriously they need to

2740
01:52:55,790 --> 01:52:59,120
be a you know admitted to briefers it is

2741
01:52:59,120 --> 01:53:03,790
a codependent relationship and yet

2742
01:53:05,860 --> 01:53:10,100
rather and so the only way to make sure

2743
01:53:10,100 --> 01:53:12,890
people understand this broadly is if we

2744
01:53:12,890 --> 01:53:14,810
all work together all right

2745
01:53:14,810 --> 01:53:18,230
if we collectively can establish a

2746
01:53:18,230 --> 01:53:21,340
corpus of evidence right a body of facts

2747
01:53:21,340 --> 01:53:26,420
that is so large and so persuasive it

2748
01:53:26,420 --> 01:53:29,530
overcomes the natural and understandable

2749
01:53:29,530 --> 01:53:32,090
resistance of these more corporatized

2750
01:53:32,090 --> 01:53:36,500
media groups it overcomes the political

2751
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:39,080
and partisan sort of loyalties that that

2752
01:53:39,080 --> 01:53:41,120
all of these political factions in the

2753
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:43,190
country do where they go you know it's

2754
01:53:43,190 --> 01:53:45,110
it's my president even if I don't like

2755
01:53:45,110 --> 01:53:46,520
this stuff even if I don't agree with

2756
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:48,710
this stuff I don't want to say it exists

2757
01:53:48,710 --> 01:53:50,900
I want to deny it until it's proved you

2758
01:53:50,900 --> 01:53:55,040
know in HD on video you know signing the

2759
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:56,650
order to do this that or the other

2760
01:53:56,650 --> 01:53:58,670
because otherwise this is a chance my

2761
01:53:58,670 --> 01:54:00,920
guy might not get reelected and that's

2762
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:02,240
the only way this kind of stuff can

2763
01:54:02,240 --> 01:54:05,360
happen and the sad fact is the

2764
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:07,610
opportunities that we have to prove this

2765
01:54:07,610 --> 01:54:09,440
like the the moments in history where we

2766
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:12,530
do prove something anything beyond a

2767
01:54:12,530 --> 01:54:17,630
reasonable doubt are so few and so rare

2768
01:54:17,630 --> 01:54:20,810
that they almost always only come from

2769
01:54:20,810 --> 01:54:24,260
whistleblowers and I think that's

2770
01:54:24,260 --> 01:54:26,350
one of the problems that we have

2771
01:54:26,350 --> 01:54:27,920
particularly in that the climate

2772
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:31,880
movement did look go ahead I'm sorry did

2773
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:34,820
you take any comfort from knowing that

2774
01:54:34,820 --> 01:54:37,100
Obama when he was running for office and

2775
01:54:37,100 --> 01:54:39,410
in his hope and change website he had

2776
01:54:39,410 --> 01:54:42,520
provisions to protect whistleblowers and

2777
01:54:42,520 --> 01:54:47,480
provisions to to reward people right I

2778
01:54:47,480 --> 01:54:48,770
mean do you remember all that I mean it

2779
01:54:48,770 --> 01:54:50,480
was eventually redacted or eventually

2780
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:54,260
deleted it from the website from yes but

2781
01:54:54,260 --> 01:54:57,230
that was a big part of his program or

2782
01:54:57,230 --> 01:54:59,360
what he was running on was that when

2783
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:02,090
people were exposing unlawful activity

2784
01:55:02,090 --> 01:55:05,030
he was going to protect those people did

2785
01:55:05,030 --> 01:55:06,380
that did you take any comfort in this

2786
01:55:06,380 --> 01:55:09,860
one campaigned well Obama also during

2787
01:55:09,860 --> 01:55:12,530
his campaign said he campaigned actively

2788
01:55:12,530 --> 01:55:14,270
against the warrantless wiretapping the

2789
01:55:14,270 --> 01:55:16,210
bush ministration because remember

2790
01:55:16,210 --> 01:55:18,320
Bush's in the scandal in the height of

2791
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:21,170
this on 2007 you know the elections

2792
01:55:21,170 --> 01:55:23,630
coming up right after and he's going oh

2793
01:55:23,630 --> 01:55:27,620
bomb Assange uh you know that's not who

2794
01:55:27,620 --> 01:55:31,580
we are right not what we do and yet

2795
01:55:31,580 --> 01:55:33,590
within a hundred days of him becoming

2796
01:55:33,590 --> 01:55:36,470
president now he's sitting in that chair

2797
01:55:36,470 --> 01:55:38,720
rather than extinguishing these programs

2798
01:55:38,720 --> 01:55:41,060
he embraces them and expands why do you

2799
01:55:41,060 --> 01:55:43,730
think that is more entrenched I think

2800
01:55:43,730 --> 01:55:45,650
it's actually again what we talked about

2801
01:55:45,650 --> 01:55:49,550
earlier first thing every time a new

2802
01:55:49,550 --> 01:55:51,580
president comes into the White House

2803
01:55:51,580 --> 01:55:54,560
they get their clearances right they get

2804
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:56,480
read into all this stuff during the

2805
01:55:56,480 --> 01:55:58,040
campaign they get clearance isn't to get

2806
01:55:58,040 --> 01:55:59,780
rid of that stuff but when they find the

2807
01:55:59,780 --> 01:56:01,880
president right now they're the only

2808
01:56:01,880 --> 01:56:03,800
people who can sign what these are

2809
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:06,260
called the covert action findings and

2810
01:56:06,260 --> 01:56:08,900
things like that which are basically you

2811
01:56:08,900 --> 01:56:10,640
know the intelligence community wants to

2812
01:56:10,640 --> 01:56:12,170
assassinate somebody they want to run

2813
01:56:12,170 --> 01:56:14,000
this illegal program here there or

2814
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:17,720
everywhere and they can't do it because

2815
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:19,700
their executive agencies without that

2816
01:56:19,700 --> 01:56:21,800
top level executive sign-off fine so

2817
01:56:21,800 --> 01:56:23,330
they got to open the vest right they got

2818
01:56:23,330 --> 01:56:26,599
to get these guys on on side

2819
01:56:26,599 --> 01:56:31,650
and basically every president since

2820
01:56:31,650 --> 01:56:34,679
Kennedy they have been successful in

2821
01:56:34,679 --> 01:56:37,650
what they call fearing up where as soon

2822
01:56:37,650 --> 01:56:39,090
as they come in

2823
01:56:39,090 --> 01:56:41,159
they lead you read you the litany of

2824
01:56:41,159 --> 01:56:43,199
Horrible's and they go these are all the

2825
01:56:43,199 --> 01:56:46,110
threats that we're facing and let's be

2826
01:56:46,110 --> 01:56:48,929
real it is a dangerous world it's not

2827
01:56:48,929 --> 01:56:52,650
just all made-up BS some of it is right

2828
01:56:52,650 --> 01:56:54,599
where it's inflated it's not that it's

2829
01:56:54,599 --> 01:56:56,369
completely false but they make it sound

2830
01:56:56,369 --> 01:56:59,849
more serious than it actually is but

2831
01:56:59,849 --> 01:57:01,500
there are real bad people out there who

2832
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:03,570
are trying to do real bad things and you

2833
01:57:03,570 --> 01:57:05,400
have just gone through a hellish

2834
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:08,639
election because our our electoral

2835
01:57:08,639 --> 01:57:14,280
politics are so diseased and now after

2836
01:57:14,280 --> 01:57:15,960
you've crawled through fire you're

2837
01:57:15,960 --> 01:57:18,000
already thinking four years ahead you

2838
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,309
know how how do I stay in this seat and

2839
01:57:20,309 --> 01:57:23,639
these guys are basically saying if you

2840
01:57:23,639 --> 01:57:26,969
don't do X Y & Z this is gonna fall on

2841
01:57:26,969 --> 01:57:29,159
your lap and the implication which I

2842
01:57:29,159 --> 01:57:30,869
don't think they actually say but every

2843
01:57:30,869 --> 01:57:33,690
president knows is these guys can

2844
01:57:33,690 --> 01:57:37,079
undermine you to death if you've got the

2845
01:57:37,079 --> 01:57:40,110
ISEE against you right they can

2846
01:57:40,110 --> 01:57:42,840
Stonewall you they can put out stories

2847
01:57:42,840 --> 01:57:44,210
that are gonna be problematic for you

2848
01:57:44,210 --> 01:57:48,780
every day your presidency and it's not

2849
01:57:48,780 --> 01:57:50,610
that it's necessarily gonna gonna catch

2850
01:57:50,610 --> 01:57:52,469
you out of the White House but it's a

2851
01:57:52,469 --> 01:57:54,179
problem that as president you very much

2852
01:57:54,179 --> 01:57:57,210
don't want so in the most charitable

2853
01:57:57,210 --> 01:57:59,699
interpretation of this you've got a new

2854
01:57:59,699 --> 01:58:01,530
guy coming in in Obama's case this is a

2855
01:58:01,530 --> 01:58:05,280
pretty young guy doesn't focus in this

2856
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:08,040
kind of national security foreign policy

2857
01:58:08,040 --> 01:58:09,480
stuff throughout his earlier career he's

2858
01:58:09,480 --> 01:58:11,849
more interested in domestic policy and

2859
01:58:11,849 --> 01:58:13,139
always has been that's actually one of

2860
01:58:13,139 --> 01:58:14,790
the positive things to say about Barack

2861
01:58:14,790 --> 01:58:17,489
Obama he's just trying to make things

2862
01:58:17,489 --> 01:58:19,500
better at home and now suddenly they go

2863
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:21,750
look you need to worry about this

2864
01:58:21,750 --> 01:58:23,040
country you need to worry about this

2865
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:24,210
group that you've never heard of you

2866
01:58:24,210 --> 01:58:25,409
need to worry about you know this

2867
01:58:25,409 --> 01:58:27,139
technology you need to do all this stuff

2868
01:58:27,139 --> 01:58:30,690
and the only reason we can tell you this

2869
01:58:30,690 --> 01:58:34,260
stuff and the only thing dividing

2870
01:58:34,260 --> 01:58:37,650
America and the abyss are these terrible

2871
01:58:37,650 --> 01:58:39,130
terrible terrible terror

2872
01:58:39,130 --> 01:58:41,980
programs right that are in fact

2873
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:44,380
wonderful things because they keep back

2874
01:58:44,380 --> 01:58:48,250
the darkness and so here's here's the

2875
01:58:48,250 --> 01:58:51,940
real problem every president hears that

2876
01:58:51,940 --> 01:58:53,500
and every president you know first off

2877
01:58:53,500 --> 01:58:55,150
they've got so many other things do is

2878
01:58:55,150 --> 01:58:56,409
they just kind of nod their head and

2879
01:58:56,409 --> 01:58:58,030
they'll go I'll deal with this later in

2880
01:58:58,030 --> 01:59:00,130
my administration and this is one of the

2881
01:59:00,130 --> 01:59:02,850
ironies when I come came forward in 2013

2882
01:59:02,850 --> 01:59:05,500
right this is now Barack Obama's second

2883
01:59:05,500 --> 01:59:09,130
term president one of the responses that

2884
01:59:09,130 --> 01:59:10,690
they had to the mass surveillance of the

2885
01:59:10,690 --> 01:59:13,330
scandal was yes we think they went a

2886
01:59:13,330 --> 01:59:14,980
little too far this is after the initial

2887
01:59:14,980 --> 01:59:16,540
thing where they went nobody's listening

2888
01:59:16,540 --> 01:59:18,610
to your phone calls you know just made a

2889
01:59:18,610 --> 01:59:22,530
data right nobody nobody can have a

2890
01:59:22,530 --> 01:59:25,210
perfect privacy and also have perfect

2891
01:59:25,210 --> 01:59:27,159
security so we got to sort of divide a

2892
01:59:27,159 --> 01:59:30,219
line here between the Constitution and

2893
01:59:30,219 --> 01:59:31,830
you know what the government wants to do

2894
01:59:31,830 --> 01:59:39,070
but they said we were gonna get to it we

2895
01:59:39,070 --> 01:59:41,170
knew these programs were problematic but

2896
01:59:41,170 --> 01:59:43,870
if they just gave us more time we would

2897
01:59:43,870 --> 01:59:46,750
have fixed them maybe it's true right

2898
01:59:46,750 --> 01:59:49,300
seems awful convenient in hindsight that

2899
01:59:49,300 --> 01:59:50,650
throughout the entirety the first time

2900
01:59:50,650 --> 01:59:52,540
well it seems like what you would say if

2901
01:59:52,540 --> 01:59:56,400
you got caught right right right but

2902
01:59:56,400 --> 02:00:00,570
look in if we're being the most generous

2903
02:00:00,570 --> 02:00:03,550
that we are here the president is

2904
02:00:03,550 --> 02:00:06,040
briefed on real and legitimate threats

2905
02:00:06,040 --> 02:00:08,590
and they scare the hell out of them I'm

2906
02:00:08,590 --> 02:00:11,920
sure and we can we can all imagine being

2907
02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:13,150
there right those those of us who

2908
02:00:13,150 --> 02:00:14,710
remember what the world was like post

2909
02:00:14,710 --> 02:00:17,710
9/11 fear is a powerful thing but the

2910
02:00:17,710 --> 02:00:21,730
guys who are doing that briefing they're

2911
02:00:21,730 --> 02:00:24,190
no longer scared of it because they've

2912
02:00:24,190 --> 02:00:25,540
been dealing with this for years this is

2913
02:00:25,540 --> 02:00:26,590
the oldest thing they've given this

2914
02:00:26,590 --> 02:00:28,360
briefing times before you know when we

2915
02:00:28,360 --> 02:00:30,010
talk about people talk about the deep

2916
02:00:30,010 --> 02:00:32,969
state right they talk about it like some

2917
02:00:32,969 --> 02:00:35,860
conspiracy of lizard people it's not

2918
02:00:35,860 --> 02:00:37,840
that it's something much simpler the

2919
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:39,100
deep state is simply the career

2920
02:00:39,100 --> 02:00:40,989
government it's the people who are in

2921
02:00:40,989 --> 02:00:43,900
the same offices who outlive and outlast

2922
02:00:43,900 --> 02:00:45,670
presidents is right they've seen

2923
02:00:45,670 --> 02:00:47,590
Republicans they've seen Democrats they

2924
02:00:47,590 --> 02:00:49,420
don't really care

2925
02:00:49,420 --> 02:00:51,400
and they give that same briefing again

2926
02:00:51,400 --> 02:00:53,349
and again and they get good at it they

2927
02:00:53,349 --> 02:00:55,869
know what they want they know what this

2928
02:00:55,869 --> 02:00:58,719
person saying where's the president they

2929
02:00:58,719 --> 02:01:01,030
don't know who these people are these

2930
02:01:01,030 --> 02:01:02,440
people who've been there before the

2931
02:01:02,440 --> 02:01:03,429
president they're gonna be there after

2932
02:01:03,429 --> 02:01:06,460
the president and so they give this very

2933
02:01:06,460 --> 02:01:08,949
effective very fear inducing speech and

2934
02:01:08,949 --> 02:01:11,590
then they followed up with their asks

2935
02:01:11,590 --> 02:01:15,550
which are really demands just politely

2936
02:01:15,550 --> 02:01:19,090
provided and anyone in that position who

2937
02:01:19,090 --> 02:01:22,000
is not an expert on this stuff who is

2938
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:26,020
not ready for this sort of trade off and

2939
02:01:26,020 --> 02:01:28,000
who you have to understand is a career

2940
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:31,900
politician is entirely used to the horse

2941
02:01:31,900 --> 02:01:33,550
trading game Rango and I'll deal with

2942
02:01:33,550 --> 02:01:36,190
this later or not now or what are the

2943
02:01:36,190 --> 02:01:38,110
this the cost-benefit here and the

2944
02:01:38,110 --> 02:01:39,969
intelligence community goes if you give

2945
02:01:39,969 --> 02:01:43,510
us what we want no one will ever know

2946
02:01:43,510 --> 02:01:46,719
about it because it's classified it's

2947
02:01:46,719 --> 02:01:49,739
obviously the easy answer and maybe

2948
02:01:49,739 --> 02:01:52,599
Barack Obama and honestly did want to

2949
02:01:52,599 --> 02:01:54,790
get to this later but what we can say

2950
02:01:54,790 --> 02:01:59,409
today is for all the good that may have

2951
02:01:59,409 --> 02:02:01,690
been done in that White House this is an

2952
02:02:01,690 --> 02:02:03,790
issue where the president went through

2953
02:02:03,790 --> 02:02:06,489
two full terms and did not fix the

2954
02:02:06,489 --> 02:02:08,650
problem but in fact made it worse well

2955
02:02:08,650 --> 02:02:11,530
it seems like the president has a job

2956
02:02:11,530 --> 02:02:13,360
it's absolutely impossible and if you

2957
02:02:13,360 --> 02:02:15,250
come across someone who has been in the

2958
02:02:15,250 --> 02:02:17,320
position like you know someone who's the

2959
02:02:17,320 --> 02:02:18,730
head of an intelligence agency for a

2960
02:02:18,730 --> 02:02:21,489
long time and it's very persuasive and

2961
02:02:21,489 --> 02:02:24,340
has some you know legitimate credentials

2962
02:02:24,340 --> 02:02:25,960
that show that he's very good at his job

2963
02:02:25,960 --> 02:02:27,760
but he tells you this is important for

2964
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:29,469
national security we need to keep these

2965
02:02:29,469 --> 02:02:33,099
things in place it doesn't seem like any

2966
02:02:33,099 --> 02:02:35,679
one person can run the country and be

2967
02:02:35,679 --> 02:02:37,960
aware of every single program that every

2968
02:02:37,960 --> 02:02:40,210
single agency is implementing it seems

2969
02:02:40,210 --> 02:02:42,159
completely unrealistic and the the job

2970
02:02:42,159 --> 02:02:44,889
itself it just it doesn't seem like any

2971
02:02:44,889 --> 02:02:47,110
person can do it adequately and when it

2972
02:02:47,110 --> 02:02:49,060
comes to something like this mass

2973
02:02:49,060 --> 02:02:52,960
surveillance state I could see a

2974
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:56,080
president being persuaded by someone who

2975
02:02:56,080 --> 02:02:59,050
comes to him and says this is why we

2976
02:02:59,050 --> 02:03:03,010
need to do this yeah I mean

2977
02:03:03,010 --> 02:03:06,790
one of the things that I think is the

2978
02:03:06,790 --> 02:03:08,830
underlying problem and everything that

2979
02:03:08,830 --> 02:03:10,270
you just described as the president has

2980
02:03:10,270 --> 02:03:13,330
too much power right and because they

2981
02:03:13,330 --> 02:03:14,440
have too much power that means they have

2982
02:03:14,440 --> 02:03:16,930
too much responsibility and I I don't

2983
02:03:16,930 --> 02:03:19,810
think people understand if they haven't

2984
02:03:19,810 --> 02:03:21,520
lived outside the United States if they

2985
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:22,900
haven't sort of traveled or studied

2986
02:03:22,900 --> 02:03:26,080
broadly just how exceptional the

2987
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:28,870
American presidency is most countries

2988
02:03:28,870 --> 02:03:31,570
don't have a single individual with this

2989
02:03:31,570 --> 02:03:35,290
level of power it's really only the

2990
02:03:35,290 --> 02:03:40,030
super States and and that may be by

2991
02:03:40,030 --> 02:03:41,440
design perhaps that's why they're

2992
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:45,300
they're super States but when we look at

2993
02:03:45,300 --> 02:03:48,190
sort of complex advanced democracies

2994
02:03:48,190 --> 02:03:51,250
that are more peaceful they tend to have

2995
02:03:51,250 --> 02:03:53,890
a more multilateral system that has more

2996
02:03:53,890 --> 02:03:56,260
people involved in smaller portfolios

2997
02:03:56,260 --> 02:03:58,420
and a lot of this derives from just the

2998
02:03:58,420 --> 02:04:00,280
size of the government like you said you

2999
02:04:00,280 --> 02:04:01,480
know the president is responsible for

3000
02:04:01,480 --> 02:04:03,190
basically everything executive branch

3001
02:04:03,190 --> 02:04:04,510
and the executive branch is basically

3002
02:04:04,510 --> 02:04:06,900
every agency that actually doesn't work

3003
02:04:06,900 --> 02:04:12,550
and so how do you how do you correct for

3004
02:04:12,550 --> 02:04:15,280
that without breaking it up where you

3005
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:17,350
have smaller ministers and ministries

3006
02:04:17,350 --> 02:04:19,150
and things like that that have different

3007
02:04:19,150 --> 02:04:20,860
levels of responsibility having a

3008
02:04:20,860 --> 02:04:22,660
smaller government overall you know back

3009
02:04:22,660 --> 02:04:27,310
in 1776 the federal government you know

3010
02:04:27,310 --> 02:04:29,350
was pretty much a dream

3011
02:04:29,350 --> 02:04:32,170
we weren't even interested in having

3012
02:04:32,170 --> 02:04:34,330
standing armies the idea of an army that

3013
02:04:34,330 --> 02:04:37,180
existed from year to year was terrifying

3014
02:04:37,180 --> 02:04:42,670
forbidding thing and then when you move

3015
02:04:42,670 --> 02:04:44,680
to this idea that we have a president

3016
02:04:44,680 --> 02:04:45,580
that they have these extraordinary

3017
02:04:45,580 --> 02:04:47,470
powers it's okay because the

3018
02:04:47,470 --> 02:04:48,940
government's very small the federal

3019
02:04:48,940 --> 02:04:50,710
government especially is seen as sort of

3020
02:04:50,710 --> 02:04:52,300
this small and toothless and weak thing

3021
02:04:52,300 --> 02:04:54,790
keep pause for one second is Spain pause

3022
02:04:54,790 --> 02:04:56,590
for one second because my ear pods are

3023
02:04:56,590 --> 02:04:58,390
about to die and I'm gonna swap over to

3024
02:04:58,390 --> 02:05:00,489
another pair these these suckers are

3025
02:05:00,489 --> 02:05:02,950
good for a couple hours but we're two

3026
02:05:02,950 --> 02:05:05,440
hours and 15 minutes here we'll have a

3027
02:05:05,440 --> 02:05:08,020
little bit of a weird audio issue with

3028
02:05:08,020 --> 02:05:09,940
the last half of it but Jamie Jamie I'll

3029
02:05:09,940 --> 02:05:12,040
take care of it I wanted to talk about

3030
02:05:12,040 --> 02:05:14,890
you like where you are right now in your

3031
02:05:14,890 --> 02:05:16,010
life and how your hand

3032
02:05:16,010 --> 02:05:19,579
this cuz you've been in exile for how

3033
02:05:19,579 --> 02:05:22,789
many years now it's been more than six

3034
02:05:22,789 --> 02:05:26,570
years six six years of 2013 yeah I mean

3035
02:05:26,570 --> 02:05:30,110
well actually I left May so what is life

3036
02:05:30,110 --> 02:05:34,579
like I mean are you in constant hiding I

3037
02:05:34,579 --> 02:05:39,050
mean what what are the issues like in in

3038
02:05:39,050 --> 02:05:43,699
the beginning my operational security

3039
02:05:43,699 --> 02:05:46,340
level as we would call it was was very

3040
02:05:46,340 --> 02:05:50,420
high I was concerned about being

3041
02:05:50,420 --> 02:05:51,769
recognized was concerned about being

3042
02:05:51,769 --> 02:05:54,920
followed I was concerned really about

3043
02:05:54,920 --> 02:05:57,170
very bad things happening to me because

3044
02:05:57,170 --> 02:05:58,699
the the government made it very clear

3045
02:05:58,699 --> 02:06:00,170
that from their position I was the most

3046
02:06:00,170 --> 02:06:03,230
wanted man in the world they literally

3047
02:06:03,230 --> 02:06:06,199
brought down the president of Bolivia

3048
02:06:06,199 --> 02:06:09,769
his aircraft and would not let it depart

3049
02:06:09,769 --> 02:06:11,869
as it tried to cross the airspace of

3050
02:06:11,869 --> 02:06:15,590
Europe not even the United States they

3051
02:06:15,590 --> 02:06:16,550
wouldn't let it leave until they

3052
02:06:16,550 --> 02:06:19,309
confirmed I was not on board so yeah

3053
02:06:19,309 --> 02:06:21,139
that made me a little bit nervous but

3054
02:06:21,139 --> 02:06:24,260
you can't live like that forever and

3055
02:06:24,260 --> 02:06:27,400
although I was as careful as I could be

3056
02:06:27,400 --> 02:06:31,909
my still lived pretty happily because I

3057
02:06:31,909 --> 02:06:33,320
was an indoor cat to begin with right

3058
02:06:33,320 --> 02:06:35,269
I've always been a technologist I've

3059
02:06:35,269 --> 02:06:38,329
always been pretty nerdy so as long as I

3060
02:06:38,329 --> 02:06:40,250
have a screen an internet connection I

3061
02:06:40,250 --> 02:06:44,119
was pretty happy but in the years past

3062
02:06:44,119 --> 02:06:45,739
my life has become more and more open

3063
02:06:45,739 --> 02:06:48,500
you know now I speak openly I live

3064
02:06:48,500 --> 02:06:51,019
openly I go out I ride the Metro I go to

3065
02:06:51,019 --> 02:06:53,090
restaurants like you know how often II

3066
02:06:53,090 --> 02:06:56,750
recognized so this is a funny thing as

3067
02:06:56,750 --> 02:06:59,780
I'm almost never recognized one of those

3068
02:06:59,780 --> 02:07:01,639
things is I don't give Russian

3069
02:07:01,639 --> 02:07:04,550
interviews because I don't want my face

3070
02:07:04,550 --> 02:07:08,269
all over the news which is nice because

3071
02:07:08,269 --> 02:07:10,519
it just allows people to sort of forget

3072
02:07:10,519 --> 02:07:15,039
about my face and I can go about my life

3073
02:07:15,039 --> 02:07:18,380
but I it's one of the weird things that

3074
02:07:18,380 --> 02:07:21,190
I'm recognized a couple times a year

3075
02:07:21,190 --> 02:07:26,090
even when I'm not wearing my glasses in

3076
02:07:26,090 --> 02:07:28,699
a museum or a grocery store or something

3077
02:07:28,699 --> 02:07:30,489
like that or out on the street

3078
02:07:30,489 --> 02:07:32,380
just by somebody who I swear like these

3079
02:07:32,380 --> 02:07:35,260
people are you might have read a story

3080
02:07:35,260 --> 02:07:36,909
about them like super recognizers the

3081
02:07:36,909 --> 02:07:38,440
people just have a great memory for

3082
02:07:38,440 --> 02:07:43,090
faces yeah because I can be like ooh Oh

3083
02:07:43,090 --> 02:07:46,059
wearing a hood and like a jacket it can

3084
02:07:46,059 --> 02:07:47,619
have a scarf around my face like in the

3085
02:07:47,619 --> 02:07:50,409
winter and it like you can barely see my

3086
02:07:50,409 --> 02:07:52,329
face and they'll come up to me and

3087
02:07:52,329 --> 02:07:54,999
they're like are you Snowden and I'm

3088
02:07:54,999 --> 02:07:57,519
like whoa that's what he uses pretty

3089
02:07:57,519 --> 02:08:01,030
impressive I'd say yeah it's nice to

3090
02:08:01,030 --> 02:08:02,469
meet you

3091
02:08:02,469 --> 02:08:05,380
and yeah they've it's I've never had a

3092
02:08:05,380 --> 02:08:07,749
negative interaction from being

3093
02:08:07,749 --> 02:08:10,210
recognized but for me none because I'm a

3094
02:08:10,210 --> 02:08:12,070
privacy advocate like I would much

3095
02:08:12,070 --> 02:08:14,469
rather go unrecognized like I don't want

3096
02:08:14,469 --> 02:08:18,340
to be a celebrity but the other thing is

3097
02:08:18,340 --> 02:08:21,489
I'll get recognized in computer stores

3098
02:08:21,489 --> 02:08:23,260
and I think there's just like a mental

3099
02:08:23,260 --> 02:08:26,949
Association where people are like their

3100
02:08:26,949 --> 02:08:29,349
brain when it's cycling through faces

3101
02:08:29,349 --> 02:08:31,090
that it recognizes it's going through

3102
02:08:31,090 --> 02:08:32,949
like the subset of nerdier people or

3103
02:08:32,949 --> 02:08:34,059
something like that when you're in a

3104
02:08:34,059 --> 02:08:35,829
computer store because for whatever

3105
02:08:35,829 --> 02:08:38,889
reason I'm recognized much more

3106
02:08:38,889 --> 02:08:40,480
frequently when there's some kind of

3107
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:45,789
technological like locusts hmm so you're

3108
02:08:45,789 --> 02:08:47,800
living freely did you had to learn

3109
02:08:47,800 --> 02:08:51,070
Russian did you learn it yeah me my my

3110
02:08:51,070 --> 02:08:53,980
Russian is still pretty crappy to talk

3111
02:08:53,980 --> 02:08:56,559
to my great shame because all of my life

3112
02:08:56,559 --> 02:08:58,690
all of my work is primarily aimed right

3113
02:08:58,690 --> 02:09:02,829
right no you've talked about returning

3114
02:09:02,829 --> 02:09:06,039
home if you could get a fair trial is is

3115
02:09:06,039 --> 02:09:10,960
that a feasible thing a fair trial for

3116
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:13,210
someone like you is that such a well is

3117
02:09:13,210 --> 02:09:16,170
that yeah that even possible question I

3118
02:09:16,170 --> 02:09:21,489
mean look if we're being Frank III I

3119
02:09:21,489 --> 02:09:24,070
think all your audience knows the chance

3120
02:09:24,070 --> 02:09:26,139
of me getting a fair shake in the

3121
02:09:26,139 --> 02:09:28,690
Eastern District of Virginia a couple

3122
02:09:28,690 --> 02:09:30,300
miles from the headquarters of the CIA

3123
02:09:30,300 --> 02:09:33,400
is probably pretty slim because that's

3124
02:09:33,400 --> 02:09:36,059
where they draw the jury pool from right

3125
02:09:36,059 --> 02:09:41,349
but my objection here is on a larger

3126
02:09:41,349 --> 02:09:42,229
print

3127
02:09:42,229 --> 02:09:44,479
right what what happens to me is less

3128
02:09:44,479 --> 02:09:46,159
important right if I spend the rest of

3129
02:09:46,159 --> 02:09:47,719
my life in jail that that's less

3130
02:09:47,719 --> 02:09:49,820
important then what I'm actually

3131
02:09:49,820 --> 02:09:51,800
requiring the government to agree to

3132
02:09:51,800 --> 02:09:54,289
which is a single thing right they say

3133
02:09:54,289 --> 02:09:55,579
face the music face the music and I'm

3134
02:09:55,579 --> 02:09:59,150
saying great let's pick the song the

3135
02:09:59,150 --> 02:10:02,929
thing is the law that I've been charged

3136
02:10:02,929 --> 02:10:04,099
under the one that all these

3137
02:10:04,099 --> 02:10:05,300
whistleblowers have been charged owner

3138
02:10:05,300 --> 02:10:07,789
Thomas Drake Daniel Ellsberg Chelsea

3139
02:10:07,789 --> 02:10:10,070
Manning Daniel Hale the drone

3140
02:10:10,070 --> 02:10:12,709
whistleblower who is in prison right now

3141
02:10:12,709 --> 02:10:14,479
going through a trial that is precisely

3142
02:10:14,479 --> 02:10:17,780
similar to what I would be facing his

3143
02:10:17,780 --> 02:10:21,979
lawyer is asking the court or telling

3144
02:10:21,979 --> 02:10:24,610
the court that we want to tell the jury

3145
02:10:24,610 --> 02:10:27,979
why he did what he did that the

3146
02:10:27,979 --> 02:10:30,170
government is violating the laws a

3147
02:10:30,170 --> 02:10:31,989
government is violating human rights

3148
02:10:31,989 --> 02:10:34,610
that these programs are immoral that

3149
02:10:34,610 --> 02:10:39,349
they're unethical this is what motivated

3150
02:10:39,349 --> 02:10:42,019
this guy to do it and the jury should be

3151
02:10:42,019 --> 02:10:43,909
able to hear why he did what he did and

3152
02:10:43,909 --> 02:10:45,440
the jury should be able to decide

3153
02:10:45,440 --> 02:10:48,559
whether that was right or wrong and the

3154
02:10:48,559 --> 02:10:51,409
government has responded you know to

3155
02:10:51,409 --> 02:10:53,239
this whistleblower argument basically

3156
02:10:53,239 --> 02:10:56,840
saying we demand the court forbid this

3157
02:10:56,840 --> 02:10:58,550
guy from breathing the word

3158
02:10:58,550 --> 02:11:01,130
whistleblower in court he cannot talk

3159
02:11:01,130 --> 02:11:03,349
about what motivated him he cannot talk

3160
02:11:03,349 --> 02:11:05,209
about what was revealed why it was

3161
02:11:05,209 --> 02:11:06,860
revealed what the impacts and effects

3162
02:11:06,860 --> 02:11:09,079
were if he can't talk about whether the

3163
02:11:09,079 --> 02:11:10,969
public benefited from it or was harmed

3164
02:11:10,969 --> 02:11:14,360
by it because it doesn't matter now this

3165
02:11:14,360 --> 02:11:15,800
might surprise a lot of people because

3166
02:11:15,800 --> 02:11:17,239
to a lot of us we think that's what a

3167
02:11:17,239 --> 02:11:18,590
jury trial is we think that's what a

3168
02:11:18,590 --> 02:11:22,820
fair trial is but the Espionage Act that

3169
02:11:22,820 --> 02:11:23,809
the government uses against

3170
02:11:23,809 --> 02:11:26,059
whistleblowers meaning broadly here the

3171
02:11:26,059 --> 02:11:31,340
sources of journalism is fairly unique

3172
02:11:31,340 --> 02:11:33,559
in the legal system in that it is what's

3173
02:11:33,559 --> 02:11:37,219
called a strict liability crime a strict

3174
02:11:37,219 --> 02:11:40,130
liability crime is what the government

3175
02:11:40,130 --> 02:11:41,690
considers to be basically a crime worse

3176
02:11:41,690 --> 02:11:43,969
than murder because if you if you

3177
02:11:43,969 --> 02:11:46,550
murdered somebody like if you just don't

3178
02:11:46,550 --> 02:11:48,139
know beat Jamie with the microphone

3179
02:11:48,139 --> 02:11:51,099
stand right now

3180
02:11:52,340 --> 02:11:54,170
you would be able to go to the court and

3181
02:11:54,170 --> 02:11:55,310
say it was self-defense

3182
02:11:55,310 --> 02:11:58,730
right yeah you you you felt threatened

3183
02:11:58,730 --> 02:12:00,230
you were in danger for your life even if

3184
02:12:00,230 --> 02:12:02,510
you weren't right even you obviously

3185
02:12:02,510 --> 02:12:04,670
weren't even if you were on tape you

3186
02:12:04,670 --> 02:12:06,590
could still argue that and the jury

3187
02:12:06,590 --> 02:12:09,020
could go you full of crap right and they

3188
02:12:09,020 --> 02:12:11,630
could convict you but if you were in

3189
02:12:11,630 --> 02:12:13,490
fact acting in self-defense if the jury

3190
02:12:13,490 --> 02:12:15,830
did in fact believe you they could take

3191
02:12:15,830 --> 02:12:17,660
that into consideration in establishing

3192
02:12:17,660 --> 02:12:18,320
their verdict

3193
02:12:18,320 --> 02:12:21,500
right strict liability crime forbid then

3194
02:12:21,500 --> 02:12:26,240
the jury is not allowed to consider why

3195
02:12:26,240 --> 02:12:28,700
you committed a crime they're only

3196
02:12:28,700 --> 02:12:31,970
allowed to consider if you committed a

3197
02:12:31,970 --> 02:12:34,100
crime they are not allowed to consider

3198
02:12:34,100 --> 02:12:35,600
if the murder was justified they are

3199
02:12:35,600 --> 02:12:37,190
only allowed to consider if the murder

3200
02:12:37,190 --> 02:12:38,960
took place and the funny thing in this

3201
02:12:38,960 --> 02:12:41,840
case is that the murder that we're

3202
02:12:41,840 --> 02:12:45,140
talking about is telling the truth the

3203
02:12:45,140 --> 02:12:50,150
Espionage Act in every case is a law the

3204
02:12:50,150 --> 02:12:52,760
government exclusively uses against

3205
02:12:52,760 --> 02:12:55,100
people who told the truth right like

3206
02:12:55,100 --> 02:12:56,330
that that's what it's about in the

3207
02:12:56,330 --> 02:12:58,340
context of journalism they don't bring

3208
02:12:58,340 --> 02:13:00,290
the Espionage Act against people who

3209
02:13:00,290 --> 02:13:02,180
lied then they would use fraud or some

3210
02:13:02,180 --> 02:13:05,870
other statute they say the government is

3211
02:13:05,870 --> 02:13:07,640
arguing in the context of whistleblowing

3212
02:13:07,640 --> 02:13:11,590
the telling a telling a important truth

3213
02:13:11,590 --> 02:13:14,600
to the American people by way of a

3214
02:13:14,600 --> 02:13:17,060
journalist is a crime worse than murder

3215
02:13:17,060 --> 02:13:19,430
and I believe and I think most Americans

3216
02:13:19,430 --> 02:13:21,770
would agree this is fundamentally in

3217
02:13:21,770 --> 02:13:25,280
defensively wrong and so my whole

3218
02:13:25,280 --> 02:13:26,180
argument with the United States

3219
02:13:26,180 --> 02:13:28,100
government since the very beginning was

3220
02:13:28,100 --> 02:13:30,080
been I'll be back for a jury trial

3221
02:13:30,080 --> 02:13:33,580
tomorrow but you have to agree to permit

3222
02:13:33,580 --> 02:13:35,840
whistleblowers a public interest offense

3223
02:13:35,840 --> 02:13:37,040
it doesn't matter whether they are

3224
02:13:37,040 --> 02:13:39,260
whistleblower or not it's just they

3225
02:13:39,260 --> 02:13:41,060
argued it's the jury that decides

3226
02:13:41,060 --> 02:13:42,650
whether they are always will blower or

3227
02:13:42,650 --> 02:13:44,750
not if they have to be able to consider

3228
02:13:44,750 --> 02:13:46,490
the motivations of why someone did what

3229
02:13:46,490 --> 02:13:49,730
they did the government says we refuse

3230
02:13:49,730 --> 02:13:52,250
to allow that because that puts the

3231
02:13:52,250 --> 02:13:54,710
government on trial and we don't trust

3232
02:13:54,710 --> 02:13:57,710
the jury to consider those questions Wow

3233
02:13:57,710 --> 02:14:00,290
so you have had these conversations then

3234
02:14:00,290 --> 02:14:02,300
so this has been discussed no this is

3235
02:14:02,300 --> 02:14:04,119
this is from the Obama administration

3236
02:14:04,119 --> 02:14:07,270
there's been no contact since since the

3237
02:14:07,270 --> 02:14:09,340
Trump administration because the

3238
02:14:09,340 --> 02:14:11,170
government basically when they got to

3239
02:14:11,170 --> 02:14:12,730
this point they went we have no good

3240
02:14:12,730 --> 02:14:15,250
argument against this and we will never

3241
02:14:15,250 --> 02:14:17,320
permit this to happen and again I just

3242
02:14:17,320 --> 02:14:19,199
want to make clear this is not

3243
02:14:19,199 --> 02:14:22,840
speculation this is not me thinking this

3244
02:14:22,840 --> 02:14:24,760
is actively happening in the case of

3245
02:14:24,760 --> 02:14:26,679
Daniel Hale right now I hope you guys

3246
02:14:26,679 --> 02:14:30,159
can pull up a graphic for because this

3247
02:14:30,159 --> 02:14:32,409
story just the papers like two or three

3248
02:14:32,409 --> 02:14:35,020
weeks ago saying the government is

3249
02:14:35,020 --> 02:14:36,580
forbidding this guy from from making

3250
02:14:36,580 --> 02:14:41,320
this argument so you're sitting in a

3251
02:14:41,320 --> 02:14:43,270
state of limbo then you're they're not

3252
02:14:43,270 --> 02:14:46,300
actively pursuing you it seems that if

3253
02:14:46,300 --> 02:14:48,610
you're able to move around freely they

3254
02:14:48,610 --> 02:14:50,230
they haven't discovered where you are

3255
02:14:50,230 --> 02:14:52,020
you're just free to live your life you

3256
02:14:52,020 --> 02:14:55,920
well yeah it's one of these things where

3257
02:14:55,920 --> 02:14:59,380
you know whether they know where I am or

3258
02:14:59,380 --> 02:15:01,360
whether they don't know where I am where

3259
02:15:01,360 --> 02:15:02,530
I put my head on the pillow doesn't

3260
02:15:02,530 --> 02:15:04,989
matter so much I'm in Russia right and

3261
02:15:04,989 --> 02:15:06,730
and we should lean into that because I

3262
02:15:06,730 --> 02:15:08,590
think people they hear Russia

3263
02:15:08,590 --> 02:15:10,420
particularly in the context of today's

3264
02:15:10,420 --> 02:15:12,280
news and you see like what people are

3265
02:15:12,280 --> 02:15:13,900
saying about tulsi gabbard and things

3266
02:15:13,900 --> 02:15:19,239
like yeah any kind of Association any

3267
02:15:19,239 --> 02:15:21,699
any time your name appears in the same

3268
02:15:21,699 --> 02:15:24,460
sentence in paragraphs same story is the

3269
02:15:24,460 --> 02:15:26,110
word Russia it's considered a negative

3270
02:15:26,110 --> 02:15:28,570
thing now yeah and don't get me wrong

3271
02:15:28,570 --> 02:15:29,949
I've been a longtime critic of the

3272
02:15:29,949 --> 02:15:30,639
Russian government

3273
02:15:30,639 --> 02:15:33,369
I just actually had a major story

3274
02:15:33,369 --> 02:15:36,659
written about me in a Russian state news

3275
02:15:36,659 --> 02:15:40,840
outlet called RIA Novosti you guys could

3276
02:15:40,840 --> 02:15:42,699
probably pull it it's only in Russian

3277
02:15:42,699 --> 02:15:46,900
though that's saying because I spoke

3278
02:15:46,900 --> 02:15:49,989
favorably about a member of the Russian

3279
02:15:49,989 --> 02:15:54,940
opposition Alexei Navalny which I wasn't

3280
02:15:54,940 --> 02:15:56,920
even speaking positively about this guy

3281
02:15:56,920 --> 02:15:58,960
I was saying look I think people have a

3282
02:15:58,960 --> 02:16:03,130
right to express their opposition in a

3283
02:16:03,130 --> 02:16:05,199
country and they should be able to do

3284
02:16:05,199 --> 02:16:07,449
that without fearing retaliation in the

3285
02:16:07,449 --> 02:16:09,520
future because the background here is

3286
02:16:09,520 --> 02:16:12,219
this this opposition figure has been a

3287
02:16:12,219 --> 02:16:13,780
long time

3288
02:16:13,780 --> 02:16:16,920
in the Russian administration side and

3289
02:16:16,920 --> 02:16:21,370
they've just suddenly magically been

3290
02:16:21,370 --> 02:16:23,260
accused of being foreign agents or

3291
02:16:23,260 --> 02:16:26,350
something like that and so everyone

3292
02:16:26,350 --> 02:16:27,850
connected to this which is like a big

3293
02:16:27,850 --> 02:16:30,219
civil society body I had their doors

3294
02:16:30,219 --> 02:16:32,110
like simultaneously kicked in across the

3295
02:16:32,110 --> 02:16:33,280
country and they're being investigated

3296
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:34,990
for some kind of corruption or something

3297
02:16:34,990 --> 02:16:38,500
indeed doesn't even matter and you know

3298
02:16:38,500 --> 02:16:40,269
I I said I opposed that just like I was

3299
02:16:40,269 --> 02:16:43,660
tweeting you know footage of ballot

3300
02:16:43,660 --> 02:16:45,429
stuffing in the Russian elections just

3301
02:16:45,429 --> 02:16:46,570
like I've criticized the Russian

3302
02:16:46,570 --> 02:16:49,080
president my name I've criticized

3303
02:16:49,080 --> 02:16:52,269
Russian surveillance laws so many things

3304
02:16:52,269 --> 02:16:53,769
again and again and again and again and

3305
02:16:53,769 --> 02:16:57,700
again but yeah so look it does not make

3306
02:16:57,700 --> 02:17:01,120
my life easier to be trapped in a

3307
02:17:01,120 --> 02:17:02,860
country that I did not choose and people

3308
02:17:02,860 --> 02:17:04,300
don't remember this I was actually on

3309
02:17:04,300 --> 02:17:06,729
route to Latin America when the US

3310
02:17:06,729 --> 02:17:08,260
government canceled my passport which

3311
02:17:08,260 --> 02:17:09,910
trapped me in Russia and for those who

3312
02:17:09,910 --> 02:17:11,769
are interested again I wrote an entire

3313
02:17:11,769 --> 02:17:15,360
book that has a lot of detail on this

3314
02:17:15,360 --> 02:17:22,120
but yeah it's difficult to be basically

3315
02:17:22,120 --> 02:17:26,019
engaged in civil opposition to policies

3316
02:17:26,019 --> 02:17:27,460
of the United States government at the

3317
02:17:27,460 --> 02:17:30,780
same time as the Russian government and

3318
02:17:30,780 --> 02:17:34,210
it's it's a hard thing you know a it's

3319
02:17:34,210 --> 02:17:35,979
not a happy thing but I feel like it's a

3320
02:17:35,979 --> 02:17:38,050
necessary thing the problem is nobody

3321
02:17:38,050 --> 02:17:39,729
wants to talk about that nobody wants to

3322
02:17:39,729 --> 02:17:41,229
engage in that kind of nuance nobody

3323
02:17:41,229 --> 02:17:42,490
wants to consider it those kind of

3324
02:17:42,490 --> 02:17:44,979
conversations in the current world

3325
02:17:44,979 --> 02:17:47,200
people believe and this sexy were the

3326
02:17:47,200 --> 02:17:50,920
worst things that Western media does in

3327
02:17:50,920 --> 02:17:53,769
in the context of discussing Russia is

3328
02:17:53,769 --> 02:17:54,910
they create this aura of invincibility

3329
02:17:54,910 --> 02:17:57,040
around the Russian president they go you

3330
02:17:57,040 --> 02:17:58,120
know this guy's calling all the shots

3331
02:17:58,120 --> 02:17:59,860
he's pulling all the strings you know

3332
02:17:59,860 --> 02:18:02,349
this guy's in charge of the world and

3333
02:18:02,349 --> 02:18:06,580
that's very useful for the Russian

3334
02:18:06,580 --> 02:18:08,710
government broadly because they can then

3335
02:18:08,710 --> 02:18:10,240
take that and replay that on their

3336
02:18:10,240 --> 02:18:11,710
domestic media and they go look how

3337
02:18:11,710 --> 02:18:13,660
strong we are you know the Americans are

3338
02:18:13,660 --> 02:18:14,889
afraid of us the Chinese are afraid of

3339
02:18:14,889 --> 02:18:16,240
his everybody's afraid of us the French

3340
02:18:16,240 --> 02:18:20,519
were afraid of us we are strong right

3341
02:18:20,519 --> 02:18:24,309
there's no question that Russia is going

3342
02:18:24,309 --> 02:18:25,760
to be interfering in elections

3343
02:18:25,760 --> 02:18:27,950
there's no question that America is

3344
02:18:27,950 --> 02:18:29,179
gonna be interfering in Russian

3345
02:18:29,179 --> 02:18:30,650
elections right and nobody nobody likes

3346
02:18:30,650 --> 02:18:31,939
to talk about this and again I need to

3347
02:18:31,939 --> 02:18:33,439
substantiate that now that I've said

3348
02:18:33,439 --> 02:18:34,790
that I've got an old note that I've

3349
02:18:34,790 --> 02:18:38,809
signed a billion times the New York

3350
02:18:38,809 --> 02:18:41,809
Times published a story in the wake of

3351
02:18:41,809 --> 02:18:43,910
you know this contestant 2016 election

3352
02:18:43,910 --> 02:18:47,300
where they looked into the history of

3353
02:18:47,300 --> 02:18:50,210
electoral interference in Russia and the

3354
02:18:50,210 --> 02:18:53,929
Soviet Union and they found in roughly

3355
02:18:53,929 --> 02:18:57,830
50 years 36 different cases of election

3356
02:18:57,830 --> 02:18:59,599
interference by Russia or the Soviets

3357
02:18:59,599 --> 02:19:00,950
right this is not a new thing this is

3358
02:19:00,950 --> 02:19:02,150
something that always happens because

3359
02:19:02,150 --> 02:19:04,219
that's what intelligence services do

3360
02:19:04,219 --> 02:19:05,960
that's what they think they're being

3361
02:19:05,960 --> 02:19:08,269
paid for which is a sad thing but it's a

3362
02:19:08,269 --> 02:19:10,849
it's a reality because we aren't wise

3363
02:19:10,849 --> 02:19:14,000
enough to separate covert action from

3364
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:17,479
intelligence gathering but in that same

3365
02:19:17,479 --> 02:19:20,229
study that they found 36 different cases

3366
02:19:20,229 --> 02:19:22,280
by the Russians in the Soviets they

3367
02:19:22,280 --> 02:19:26,210
found 81 different cases by the US and

3368
02:19:26,210 --> 02:19:27,889
this was published by a Scott chain in

3369
02:19:27,889 --> 02:19:29,570
the New York Times and both the

3370
02:19:29,570 --> 02:19:32,420
Washington Post as well but this is this

3371
02:19:32,420 --> 02:19:36,019
is the thing like there is a way to

3372
02:19:36,019 --> 02:19:37,580
criticize the Russian government's

3373
02:19:37,580 --> 02:19:41,540
policies without criticizing the Russian

3374
02:19:41,540 --> 02:19:45,200
people who are ordinary people who just

3375
02:19:45,200 --> 02:19:46,939
want to have a happy life they just want

3376
02:19:46,939 --> 02:19:48,080
to do better they want the same things

3377
02:19:48,080 --> 02:19:50,180
that you do right and every time people

3378
02:19:50,180 --> 02:19:52,160
go all Russia Russia Russia every time

3379
02:19:52,160 --> 02:19:53,780
people go Russia bad every time they go

3380
02:19:53,780 --> 02:19:55,130
Russia's doing this they go Russia's

3381
02:19:55,130 --> 02:19:57,560
doing that Russian people who have

3382
02:19:57,560 --> 02:19:59,000
nothing to do with the government feel

3383
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:02,780
implicated by that like do you feel like

3384
02:20:02,780 --> 02:20:04,580
you're in charge of Donald Trump like do

3385
02:20:04,580 --> 02:20:06,860
you want to be have Donald Trump's

3386
02:20:06,860 --> 02:20:09,770
legacy around your neck and then people

3387
02:20:09,770 --> 02:20:11,420
go oh well you know you could overthrow

3388
02:20:11,420 --> 02:20:12,770
Donald Trump you know you could

3389
02:20:12,770 --> 02:20:14,720
overthrow Putin can you really like is

3390
02:20:14,720 --> 02:20:19,070
that how it works so yeah I mean look I

3391
02:20:19,070 --> 02:20:22,130
have no affiliation I have no love for

3392
02:20:22,130 --> 02:20:23,570
the Russian government it's not my

3393
02:20:23,570 --> 02:20:26,240
choice to be here and I've made it very

3394
02:20:26,240 --> 02:20:28,040
clear I would be happy to return home is

3395
02:20:28,040 --> 02:20:30,170
there any concern that they would deny

3396
02:20:30,170 --> 02:20:33,530
you visa I mean how how are you staying

3397
02:20:33,530 --> 02:20:36,229
there it's it's a good question so I

3398
02:20:36,229 --> 02:20:38,090
have a permanent residence people think

3399
02:20:38,090 --> 02:20:38,830
I'm on our side

3400
02:20:38,830 --> 02:20:41,370
no longer it's like a green card now

3401
02:20:41,370 --> 02:20:43,800
it's got to be renewed every three years

3402
02:20:43,800 --> 02:20:46,061
so yeah sure it's possible they could

3403
02:20:46,061 --> 02:20:47,440
kick me out and this was what the story

3404
02:20:47,440 --> 02:20:48,850
I was telling you about before in

3405
02:20:48,850 --> 02:20:50,561
Russian media was they were saying you

3406
02:20:50,561 --> 02:20:51,730
know the Russian government should take

3407
02:20:51,730 --> 02:20:53,950
some action against me or shouldn't be

3408
02:20:53,950 --> 02:20:56,350
welcome here or I should go home because

3409
02:20:56,350 --> 02:20:58,271
why is he criticizing the Russian

3410
02:20:58,271 --> 02:20:59,890
government right when they're the people

3411
02:20:59,890 --> 02:21:01,780
is that like the Russian version of Fox

3412
02:21:01,780 --> 02:21:06,160
News I don't know enough about Russian

3413
02:21:06,160 --> 02:21:08,740
media to tell you I think it's supposed

3414
02:21:08,740 --> 02:21:10,420
to be more like a Reuters or Associated

3415
02:21:10,420 --> 02:21:15,670
Press but the hell if I know but the the

3416
02:21:15,670 --> 02:21:20,100
the thing is this what's the alternative

3417
02:21:20,100 --> 02:21:23,680
right yes the Russian government could

3418
02:21:23,680 --> 02:21:26,771
screw me but they could screw me even if

3419
02:21:26,771 --> 02:21:29,230
I didn't say anything and so should I

3420
02:21:29,230 --> 02:21:31,570
shut up and be quiet in the face of

3421
02:21:31,570 --> 02:21:34,080
things that I think are in Justices

3422
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:37,420
because it makes me safer well a lot of

3423
02:21:37,420 --> 02:21:39,370
pragmatic people will say yeah they say

3424
02:21:39,370 --> 02:21:40,570
you've done enough they saying you've

3425
02:21:40,570 --> 02:21:42,070
done your part you know they say

3426
02:21:42,070 --> 02:21:47,021
whatever be safe live long be happy but

3427
02:21:47,021 --> 02:21:48,700
I didn't come forward to be safe if I

3428
02:21:48,700 --> 02:21:50,230
wanted to be safe I'd still be sitting

3429
02:21:50,230 --> 02:21:52,330
in Hawaii making a hell of a lot of

3430
02:21:52,330 --> 02:21:55,480
money to spy on all of you right and

3431
02:21:55,480 --> 02:21:56,860
nobody ever would have known about this

3432
02:21:56,860 --> 02:21:59,620
the system would have gotten worse but

3433
02:21:59,620 --> 02:22:03,280
the system the world the future gets

3434
02:22:03,280 --> 02:22:06,010
worse every day that we don't do

3435
02:22:06,010 --> 02:22:07,510
something about every day that we stay

3436
02:22:07,510 --> 02:22:09,460
silent about all the injustice as we see

3437
02:22:09,460 --> 02:22:11,740
the world gets worse things get worse

3438
02:22:11,740 --> 02:22:13,870
and yeah it's risky yeah it's

3439
02:22:13,870 --> 02:22:16,720
uncomfortable but that's why we do it

3440
02:22:16,720 --> 02:22:20,080
because if we don't no one else will all

3441
02:22:20,080 --> 02:22:22,210
those years I was sitting hoping for

3442
02:22:22,210 --> 02:22:24,280
someone else to come forward and no one

3443
02:22:24,280 --> 02:22:26,140
did right that's because I was waiting

3444
02:22:26,140 --> 02:22:29,500
for a hero but there are no heroes right

3445
02:22:29,500 --> 02:22:31,420
there's only heroic decisions you are

3446
02:22:31,420 --> 02:22:33,400
never further than one decision away

3447
02:22:33,400 --> 02:22:35,380
from making a difference doesn't matter

3448
02:22:35,380 --> 02:22:36,250
where there's a big difference doesn't

3449
02:22:36,250 --> 02:22:37,600
matter if it was a small difference

3450
02:22:37,600 --> 02:22:39,280
because you don't have to save the world

3451
02:22:39,280 --> 02:22:43,390
by yourself in fact you can't all you

3452
02:22:43,390 --> 02:22:45,730
have to do is lay down one brick right

3453
02:22:45,730 --> 02:22:47,200
all you have to do is make things a

3454
02:22:47,200 --> 02:22:50,160
little bit better in a small way so

3455
02:22:50,160 --> 02:22:51,570
other people can lay their brick on top

3456
02:22:51,570 --> 02:22:55,290
of that or beside and together step by

3457
02:22:55,290 --> 02:22:57,601
step day by day year by year we build

3458
02:22:57,601 --> 02:23:00,450
the foundation of something better but

3459
02:23:00,450 --> 02:23:03,000
yeah it's not gonna be safe but it

3460
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:06,720
doesn't matter because individually it's

3461
02:23:06,720 --> 02:23:11,880
it's not you know me whoever you are

3462
02:23:11,880 --> 02:23:14,550
that's the Ironman well I don't care if

3463
02:23:14,550 --> 02:23:16,380
you're the biggest doomsday prepper with

3464
02:23:16,380 --> 02:23:19,351
cans full of beans if the world ends

3465
02:23:19,351 --> 02:23:22,290
it's going to affect you we make things

3466
02:23:22,290 --> 02:23:25,590
better we become safe together right

3467
02:23:25,590 --> 02:23:27,360
collectively that is our strength that

3468
02:23:27,360 --> 02:23:29,070
is the power of civilization that is the

3469
02:23:29,070 --> 02:23:31,410
power that shapes the future because

3470
02:23:31,410 --> 02:23:32,851
even if you make life great for you

3471
02:23:32,851 --> 02:23:35,790
you're gonna die someday you're gonna be

3472
02:23:35,790 --> 02:23:39,360
forgotten someday your cans of beans are

3473
02:23:39,360 --> 02:23:42,000
gonna rot someday you can make things

3474
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:46,710
safe or you can be more careful right

3475
02:23:46,710 --> 02:23:48,240
you can be more clever and there's

3476
02:23:48,240 --> 02:23:50,400
nothing wrong with that but at the end

3477
02:23:50,400 --> 02:23:52,050
of the day you have to recognize if

3478
02:23:52,050 --> 02:23:54,000
you're trying to eliminate all risks

3479
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:55,860
from your life what you're actually

3480
02:23:55,860 --> 02:23:58,710
doing is eliminating all possibility

3481
02:23:58,710 --> 02:24:00,570
from your life you you're trying to

3482
02:24:00,570 --> 02:24:04,680
collapse the universe of outcomes such

3483
02:24:04,680 --> 02:24:07,260
that what you've lost is freedom you've

3484
02:24:07,260 --> 02:24:09,120
lost the ability to act because you were

3485
02:24:09,120 --> 02:24:09,660
afraid

3486
02:24:09,660 --> 02:24:11,910
that's a beautiful into this mess that's

3487
02:24:11,910 --> 02:24:14,730
a beautiful way to put it are you aware

3488
02:24:14,730 --> 02:24:17,030
at all of the current state of

3489
02:24:17,030 --> 02:24:19,680
surveillance and what if anything has

3490
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:23,490
changed since your revelations yeah I

3491
02:24:23,490 --> 02:24:26,630
mean the big thing that's changed since

3492
02:24:26,630 --> 02:24:32,760
I was in 2013 is now it's mobile first

3493
02:24:32,760 --> 02:24:37,530
everything mobile was still a big deal

3494
02:24:37,530 --> 02:24:40,561
right and the intelligence community was

3495
02:24:40,561 --> 02:24:43,830
very much grappling to get its hands

3496
02:24:43,830 --> 02:24:46,650
around it and to deal with it but now

3497
02:24:46,650 --> 02:24:48,420
people are much less likely to use

3498
02:24:48,420 --> 02:24:51,510
laptop then use a desktop than then use

3499
02:24:51,510 --> 02:24:54,351
you know God any kind of wired phone

3500
02:24:54,351 --> 02:24:57,870
then they are to use a smart phone and

3501
02:24:57,870 --> 02:25:00,230
both Apple and Android devices

3502
02:25:00,230 --> 02:25:01,979
unfortunately

3503
02:25:01,979 --> 02:25:05,310
are not especially good in protecting

3504
02:25:05,310 --> 02:25:10,440
your privacy think right now you got a

3505
02:25:10,440 --> 02:25:12,000
smartphone right you might be listening

3506
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,760
to this on a train somewhere and in

3507
02:25:14,760 --> 02:25:17,820
traffic right now or you Joe right now

3508
02:25:17,820 --> 02:25:19,320
you got a phone somewhere in the room

3509
02:25:19,320 --> 02:25:23,640
right the phone is turned off or at

3510
02:25:23,640 --> 02:25:25,320
least the screen is turned off it's

3511
02:25:25,320 --> 02:25:28,800
sitting there it's powered on and if

3512
02:25:28,800 --> 02:25:30,750
somebody sends you a message the screen

3513
02:25:30,750 --> 02:25:36,440
blinks to life how does that happen but

3514
02:25:36,440 --> 02:25:38,970
how is it that if someone from any

3515
02:25:38,970 --> 02:25:41,100
corner of the earth dials a number your

3516
02:25:41,100 --> 02:25:43,350
phone rings and nobody else's rings how

3517
02:25:43,350 --> 02:25:44,910
is it you can dial anybody else's number

3518
02:25:44,910 --> 02:25:47,670
and only their phone rings right every

3519
02:25:47,670 --> 02:25:50,880
smartphone every phone at all is

3520
02:25:50,880 --> 02:25:53,160
constantly connected to the nearest

3521
02:25:53,160 --> 02:25:56,130
cellular tower every phone even when the

3522
02:25:56,130 --> 02:25:57,960
screen is off you think it's doing

3523
02:25:57,960 --> 02:25:59,580
nothing you can't see it because radio

3524
02:25:59,580 --> 02:26:02,760
frequency emissions are invisible it's

3525
02:26:02,760 --> 02:26:05,220
screaming in the air saying Here I am

3526
02:26:05,220 --> 02:26:06,830
Here I am

3527
02:26:06,830 --> 02:26:10,560
here is my IMEI I think it's an

3528
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:12,810
individual manufacturers Equipment

3529
02:26:12,810 --> 02:26:16,860
Identity and IMEI individual

3530
02:26:16,860 --> 02:26:19,920
manufacturers subscriber identity I

3531
02:26:19,920 --> 02:26:22,140
could be wrong on the break out there

3532
02:26:22,140 --> 02:26:24,780
but the the acronyms are the IMEI and

3533
02:26:24,780 --> 02:26:27,030
the IMSI and you can search for these

3534
02:26:27,030 --> 02:26:28,740
things there are two globally unique

3535
02:26:28,740 --> 02:26:32,220
identifiers that only exist anywhere in

3536
02:26:32,220 --> 02:26:35,580
the world in one place right this makes

3537
02:26:35,580 --> 02:26:36,660
your phone different than all my other

3538
02:26:36,660 --> 02:26:39,930
phones the IMEI is burned into the hand

3539
02:26:39,930 --> 02:26:41,550
side of your phone no matter what SIM

3540
02:26:41,550 --> 02:26:44,220
card you changed to it's always gonna be

3541
02:26:44,220 --> 02:26:45,390
the same and it's always gonna be

3542
02:26:45,390 --> 02:26:46,710
telling the phone network it's this

3543
02:26:46,710 --> 02:26:50,130
physical handset the IME si

3544
02:26:50,130 --> 02:26:53,070
is in your SIM card right and this is

3545
02:26:53,070 --> 02:26:54,479
what holds your phone number right it's

3546
02:26:54,479 --> 02:26:56,190
the basically the key the right to use

3547
02:26:56,190 --> 02:26:58,650
that phone number and so your phone is

3548
02:26:58,650 --> 02:27:00,810
sitting there doing nothing you think

3549
02:27:00,810 --> 02:27:03,120
but it's constantly shouting and saying

3550
02:27:03,120 --> 02:27:06,180
I'm here who is closest to me that's a

3551
02:27:06,180 --> 02:27:08,790
cell phone tower and every cell phone

3552
02:27:08,790 --> 02:27:11,910
tower with its big ears is listening for

3553
02:27:11,910 --> 02:27:14,190
these little cries for help and going

3554
02:27:14,190 --> 02:27:15,140
alright

3555
02:27:15,140 --> 02:27:17,540
I see Joe Rogan's phone right I see

3556
02:27:17,540 --> 02:27:19,790
Jaime's phone I see all these phones

3557
02:27:19,790 --> 02:27:21,650
they're here right now

3558
02:27:21,650 --> 02:27:26,230
and it compares notes with the other

3559
02:27:26,230 --> 02:27:28,610
Network towers and your smartphone

3560
02:27:28,610 --> 02:27:30,920
compares notes with them to go who do I

3561
02:27:30,920 --> 02:27:34,970
hear the loudest and who you hear the

3562
02:27:34,970 --> 02:27:38,480
loudest is a proxy for proximity for

3563
02:27:38,480 --> 02:27:41,150
closeness distance right they go whoever

3564
02:27:41,150 --> 02:27:43,160
I hear more loudly than anybody else

3565
02:27:43,160 --> 02:27:45,080
that's close to me so you're gonna be

3566
02:27:45,080 --> 02:27:46,640
bound to this cell phone tower and that

3567
02:27:46,640 --> 02:27:48,320
cell phone tower is gonna make a note a

3568
02:27:48,320 --> 02:27:53,300
permanent record saying this phone this

3569
02:27:53,300 --> 02:27:56,630
phone handset with this phone number at

3570
02:27:56,630 --> 02:27:59,660
this time was connected to me right and

3571
02:27:59,660 --> 02:28:01,790
based on your phone handset and your

3572
02:28:01,790 --> 02:28:04,880
phone number they can get your identity

3573
02:28:04,880 --> 02:28:07,700
right because you pay for this stuff

3574
02:28:07,700 --> 02:28:08,660
with your credit card and everything

3575
02:28:08,660 --> 02:28:11,690
like that and even if you don't right

3576
02:28:11,690 --> 02:28:13,510
it's still active at your house

3577
02:28:13,510 --> 02:28:15,740
overnight it's still active you know on

3578
02:28:15,740 --> 02:28:16,880
your nightstand when you're sleeping

3579
02:28:16,880 --> 02:28:20,271
it's still whatever the movements of

3580
02:28:20,271 --> 02:28:21,710
your phone are the movements of you as a

3581
02:28:21,710 --> 02:28:24,230
person and those are often quite ly

3582
02:28:24,230 --> 02:28:26,360
uniquely identifying it goes to your

3583
02:28:26,360 --> 02:28:28,490
home it goes to your workplace other

3584
02:28:28,490 --> 02:28:31,480
people don't have it sorry

3585
02:28:31,840 --> 02:28:34,130
and anyway it's constantly shouting this

3586
02:28:34,130 --> 02:28:35,300
out and then it compares notes with the

3587
02:28:35,300 --> 02:28:37,610
other parts and network and when

3588
02:28:37,610 --> 02:28:39,950
somebody is trying to get to a phone it

3589
02:28:39,950 --> 02:28:42,140
compares notes of the network compares

3590
02:28:42,140 --> 02:28:44,271
notes to go where is this phone with

3591
02:28:44,271 --> 02:28:47,120
this phone number in the world right now

3592
02:28:47,120 --> 02:28:50,240
and to that cell phone tower that is

3593
02:28:50,240 --> 02:28:52,490
closest to that phone it sends out a

3594
02:28:52,490 --> 02:28:54,830
signal saying we have a call for you

3595
02:28:54,830 --> 02:28:57,350
make your phones start ringing so your

3596
02:28:57,350 --> 02:28:59,300
owner can answer it and then it connects

3597
02:28:59,300 --> 02:29:00,680
it across this whole path but what this

3598
02:29:00,680 --> 02:29:02,900
means is that whenever you're carrying a

3599
02:29:02,900 --> 02:29:04,480
phone ever the phone is turned on

3600
02:29:04,480 --> 02:29:07,280
there's a record of your presence at

3601
02:29:07,280 --> 02:29:09,110
that place that is being made and

3602
02:29:09,110 --> 02:29:12,170
created by companies it does not need to

3603
02:29:12,170 --> 02:29:14,030
be kept forever and as fact there's no

3604
02:29:14,030 --> 02:29:15,561
good argument for it to be kept forever

3605
02:29:15,561 --> 02:29:17,870
but these companies see that is valuable

3606
02:29:17,870 --> 02:29:20,000
information Ryan this is the whole big

3607
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:21,590
data problem that we're running into and

3608
02:29:21,590 --> 02:29:23,870
all this information that used to be

3609
02:29:23,870 --> 02:29:25,970
ephemeral right where were you when you

3610
02:29:25,970 --> 02:29:27,569
were 8 years old you know

3611
02:29:27,569 --> 02:29:29,640
we're worried where'd you go after you

3612
02:29:29,640 --> 02:29:31,620
had a bad breakup you know who'd you

3613
02:29:31,620 --> 02:29:32,670
spend the night with who'd you call

3614
02:29:32,670 --> 02:29:34,830
after all this information used to be

3615
02:29:34,830 --> 02:29:37,380
ephemeral meaning it disappeared right

3616
02:29:37,380 --> 02:29:39,149
like like the morning dew it would be

3617
02:29:39,149 --> 02:29:41,520
gone no one would remember it but now

3618
02:29:41,520 --> 02:29:43,979
these things are stored now these things

3619
02:29:43,979 --> 02:29:45,540
are saved it doesn't matter whether

3620
02:29:45,540 --> 02:29:47,040
you're doing anything wrong it doesn't

3621
02:29:47,040 --> 02:29:48,270
matter whether you're the most ordinary

3622
02:29:48,270 --> 02:29:52,109
person on earth because that's how bulk

3623
02:29:52,109 --> 02:29:54,029
collection which is the government's

3624
02:29:54,029 --> 02:29:56,460
euphemism for mass surveillance works

3625
02:29:56,460 --> 02:29:58,859
they simply collected all in advance in

3626
02:29:58,859 --> 02:30:00,569
hopes that one day it will become useful

3627
02:30:00,569 --> 02:30:05,220
and that was just talking about how you

3628
02:30:05,220 --> 02:30:07,200
connected phone network that's not

3629
02:30:07,200 --> 02:30:08,880
talking about all those apps on your

3630
02:30:08,880 --> 02:30:11,310
phone that are contacting the network

3631
02:30:11,310 --> 02:30:15,390
even more frequently right how do you

3632
02:30:15,390 --> 02:30:16,859
get a text message notification how do

3633
02:30:16,859 --> 02:30:18,930
you get an email notification how is it

3634
02:30:18,930 --> 02:30:20,609
the Facebook knows where you're at you

3635
02:30:20,609 --> 02:30:24,200
know all of these things these analytics

3636
02:30:24,200 --> 02:30:26,399
they are trying to keep track through

3637
02:30:26,399 --> 02:30:28,350
location services on your phone to GPS

3638
02:30:28,350 --> 02:30:30,479
through even just what wireless access

3639
02:30:30,479 --> 02:30:32,069
points you're connected to because

3640
02:30:32,069 --> 02:30:34,170
there's a global constantly updated map

3641
02:30:34,170 --> 02:30:35,460
there's actually many of them of

3642
02:30:35,460 --> 02:30:37,470
wireless access points in the world

3643
02:30:37,470 --> 02:30:38,910
because just like we talked about every

3644
02:30:38,910 --> 02:30:40,500
phone has a unique identifier that's

3645
02:30:40,500 --> 02:30:42,750
globally unique every wireless access

3646
02:30:42,750 --> 02:30:45,240
point in the world right you cable modem

3647
02:30:45,240 --> 02:30:46,319
at home

3648
02:30:46,319 --> 02:30:48,029
whether it's in your laptop every device

3649
02:30:48,029 --> 02:30:50,850
that has a radio modem has a globally

3650
02:30:50,850 --> 02:30:55,529
unique identifier in it and this is

3651
02:30:55,529 --> 02:30:57,600
standard term you can look it up and

3652
02:30:57,600 --> 02:30:59,729
these things can be mapped when they're

3653
02:30:59,729 --> 02:31:01,890
broadcasting in the air because again

3654
02:31:01,890 --> 02:31:03,930
like your phone says to the cell phone

3655
02:31:03,930 --> 02:31:06,720
tower I have this identifier the cell

3656
02:31:06,720 --> 02:31:08,670
phone tower responds and says I have

3657
02:31:08,670 --> 02:31:09,960
this identifier and anybody who's

3658
02:31:09,960 --> 02:31:12,330
listening they can write these things

3659
02:31:12,330 --> 02:31:14,430
down and all there's Google Street View

3660
02:31:14,430 --> 02:31:16,260
cars that go back and forth right

3661
02:31:16,260 --> 02:31:20,160
they're keeping notes on whose Wi-Fi is

3662
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:22,770
active on this block right and then they

3663
02:31:22,770 --> 02:31:24,660
build a new giant map so even if you

3664
02:31:24,660 --> 02:31:27,540
have GPS turned off right as long as you

3665
02:31:27,540 --> 02:31:30,870
connect to the Wi-Fi those apps can go

3666
02:31:30,870 --> 02:31:34,200
well I I'm connected to Joe's Wi-Fi but

3667
02:31:34,200 --> 02:31:36,330
I can also see his neighbor's Wi-Fi here

3668
02:31:36,330 --> 02:31:38,100
and the other one in this apartment over

3669
02:31:38,100 --> 02:31:39,090
here and the other one in the apartment

3670
02:31:39,090 --> 02:31:40,229
here

3671
02:31:40,229 --> 02:31:42,859
and you should only be able to hear

3672
02:31:42,859 --> 02:31:46,260
those four globally unique Wi-Fi access

3673
02:31:46,260 --> 02:31:49,260
points from these points in physical

3674
02:31:49,260 --> 02:31:51,689
space right the intersection in between

3675
02:31:51,689 --> 02:31:54,499
the spreads the domes of all those

3676
02:31:54,499 --> 02:31:56,909
wireless access points it's a proxy for

3677
02:31:56,909 --> 02:31:59,369
location and it just goes on and on and

3678
02:31:59,369 --> 02:32:00,390
on we could talk about this for four

3679
02:32:00,390 --> 02:32:01,560
more hours we don't have that kind of

3680
02:32:01,560 --> 02:32:01,890
time

3681
02:32:01,890 --> 02:32:03,539
can I ask you this is there a way to

3682
02:32:03,539 --> 02:32:05,789
mitigate any of this personally I mean

3683
02:32:05,789 --> 02:32:08,550
is shutting your phone off doesn't even

3684
02:32:08,550 --> 02:32:12,689
work right well so it does in a way it's

3685
02:32:12,689 --> 02:32:14,340
just no uhm the thing was shutting your

3686
02:32:14,340 --> 02:32:16,319
phone off that is a risk is how do you

3687
02:32:16,319 --> 02:32:19,260
know any phones actually turned off it

3688
02:32:19,260 --> 02:32:21,840
used to be when I was in Geneva for

3689
02:32:21,840 --> 02:32:26,670
example working for the CIA we would all

3690
02:32:26,670 --> 02:32:29,970
carry like drug dealer phones you know

3691
02:32:29,970 --> 02:32:32,640
the old smart phones there sorry old

3692
02:32:32,640 --> 02:32:35,100
dumb phones they're not smart phones and

3693
02:32:35,100 --> 02:32:37,550
the reason why was just because they had

3694
02:32:37,550 --> 02:32:40,109
removable battery bags where you could

3695
02:32:40,109 --> 02:32:42,899
take the battery out right and the one

3696
02:32:42,899 --> 02:32:44,909
beautiful thing about technology is if

3697
02:32:44,909 --> 02:32:46,649
there's no electricity in it right if

3698
02:32:46,649 --> 02:32:49,590
there's no go juice available to it if

3699
02:32:49,590 --> 02:32:51,449
there's no battery connected to it it's

3700
02:32:51,449 --> 02:32:53,010
not sending anything because you have to

3701
02:32:53,010 --> 02:32:54,600
get power from somewhere you have to

3702
02:32:54,600 --> 02:32:59,399
have power in order to do work but now

3703
02:32:59,399 --> 02:33:01,020
your phones are all sealed right you

3704
02:33:01,020 --> 02:33:03,569
can't take the batteries out so there

3705
02:33:03,569 --> 02:33:05,819
are potential ways that you can hack a

3706
02:33:05,819 --> 02:33:07,529
phone where it appears to be off but

3707
02:33:07,529 --> 02:33:09,359
it's not actually off it's just

3708
02:33:09,359 --> 02:33:11,010
pretending to be off whereas in fact

3709
02:33:11,010 --> 02:33:12,479
it's still listening in and doing all

3710
02:33:12,479 --> 02:33:14,659
this stuff but for the average person

3711
02:33:14,659 --> 02:33:17,460
that doesn't apply right and I got to

3712
02:33:17,460 --> 02:33:19,289
tell you guys they've been chasing me

3713
02:33:19,289 --> 02:33:21,569
all over the place I don't worry about

3714
02:33:21,569 --> 02:33:24,779
that stuff right and it's because if

3715
02:33:24,779 --> 02:33:26,279
they are applying that level of effort

3716
02:33:26,279 --> 02:33:28,859
to me they'll probably get the same

3717
02:33:28,859 --> 02:33:32,069
information through other routes I am as

3718
02:33:32,069 --> 02:33:34,560
careful as I can and I use things like

3719
02:33:34,560 --> 02:33:36,930
Faraday cages I turn devices off but if

3720
02:33:36,930 --> 02:33:40,079
they're actually manipulating the way

3721
02:33:40,079 --> 02:33:43,109
devices display it's just too great a

3722
02:33:43,109 --> 02:33:44,729
level of effort even for someone like me

3723
02:33:44,729 --> 02:33:47,149
to keep that up on a constant basis also

3724
02:33:47,149 --> 02:33:50,909
if they get me I only trust phones so

3725
02:33:50,909 --> 02:33:52,680
much so there's only so much they can

3726
02:33:52,680 --> 02:33:53,471
derive from

3727
02:33:53,471 --> 02:33:55,451
compromise and this is how operational

3728
02:33:55,451 --> 02:33:58,900
security works you think about what are

3729
02:33:58,900 --> 02:34:00,490
the realistic threats that you're facing

3730
02:34:00,490 --> 02:34:03,551
that you're trying to mitigate and with

3731
02:34:03,551 --> 02:34:05,351
the mitigation that you're trying to do

3732
02:34:05,351 --> 02:34:08,110
is what would be the loss what would be

3733
02:34:08,110 --> 02:34:11,171
the damage done to you if this stuff was

3734
02:34:11,171 --> 02:34:13,961
exploited much more realistic than

3735
02:34:13,961 --> 02:34:15,551
worrying about these things that I call

3736
02:34:15,551 --> 02:34:17,141
voodoo hacks right which are like

3737
02:34:17,141 --> 02:34:19,391
next-level stuff and actually just a

3738
02:34:19,391 --> 02:34:21,671
shout out for those of your readers who

3739
02:34:21,671 --> 02:34:24,280
are interested in this stuff fun I wrote

3740
02:34:24,280 --> 02:34:26,951
a paper on this specific problem how do

3741
02:34:26,951 --> 02:34:28,511
you know when a phone is actually off

3742
02:34:28,511 --> 02:34:29,801
how do you know when it's actually not

3743
02:34:29,801 --> 02:34:32,740
spying on you with a brilliant brilliant

3744
02:34:32,740 --> 02:34:35,951
guy named Andrew bunny Huang he's an MIT

3745
02:34:35,951 --> 02:34:39,990
PhD and I think electrical engineering

3746
02:34:39,990 --> 02:34:43,570
called the introspection engine that was

3747
02:34:43,570 --> 02:34:45,161
published in the Journal of hope and

3748
02:34:45,161 --> 02:34:48,280
engineering you can find it online and

3749
02:34:48,280 --> 02:34:50,081
it'll go as deep down in the weeds I

3750
02:34:50,081 --> 02:34:51,851
promise you it as you want we take an

3751
02:34:51,851 --> 02:34:54,671
iPhone 6 this was back when it was

3752
02:34:54,671 --> 02:34:57,011
fairly new and we modified it so we

3753
02:34:57,011 --> 02:35:00,311
could actually not trust the device to

3754
02:35:00,311 --> 02:35:01,871
report its own state but physically

3755
02:35:01,871 --> 02:35:03,190
monitor its state to see if were spying

3756
02:35:03,190 --> 02:35:06,251
on you but for average people right this

3757
02:35:06,251 --> 02:35:10,061
academic that's not your primary thread

3758
02:35:10,061 --> 02:35:12,371
your primary threats are these bulk

3759
02:35:12,371 --> 02:35:14,831
collection programs your primary threat

3760
02:35:14,831 --> 02:35:16,811
is the fact that your phone is

3761
02:35:16,811 --> 02:35:18,940
constantly squawking to these cell phone

3762
02:35:18,940 --> 02:35:20,261
towers it's doing all of these things

3763
02:35:20,261 --> 02:35:22,480
because we leave our phones a mistake

3764
02:35:22,480 --> 02:35:25,240
that is constantly on your constantly

3765
02:35:25,240 --> 02:35:27,911
connected right airplane mode doesn't

3766
02:35:27,911 --> 02:35:30,161
even turn off Wi-Fi really anymore it

3767
02:35:30,161 --> 02:35:33,461
just turns off the cellular modem but

3768
02:35:33,461 --> 02:35:36,461
the whole idea is we need to identify

3769
02:35:36,461 --> 02:35:39,311
the problem and the central problem with

3770
02:35:39,311 --> 02:35:41,831
smart phone use today is you have no

3771
02:35:41,831 --> 02:35:43,331
idea what the hell it's doing at any

3772
02:35:43,331 --> 02:35:45,251
given time like the phone has the screen

3773
02:35:45,251 --> 02:35:46,780
off you don't know what it's connected

3774
02:35:46,780 --> 02:35:48,280
to you don't know how frequently it's

3775
02:35:48,280 --> 02:35:51,431
doing it Apple and iOS unfortunately

3776
02:35:51,431 --> 02:35:53,530
makes it impossible to see what kind of

3777
02:35:53,530 --> 02:35:55,331
network connections are constantly made

3778
02:35:55,331 --> 02:35:57,251
on the device and to inter mediate them

3779
02:35:57,251 --> 02:35:59,351
going I don't want Facebook to be able

3780
02:35:59,351 --> 02:36:00,911
to talk right now you know I don't want

3781
02:36:00,911 --> 02:36:02,501
Google to be able to talk right now

3782
02:36:02,501 --> 02:36:05,501
I just want my secure messenger app to

3783
02:36:05,501 --> 02:36:05,730
be

3784
02:36:05,730 --> 02:36:08,280
the talk I just want my weather app to

3785
02:36:08,280 --> 02:36:09,870
be able to talk but I just checked my

3786
02:36:09,870 --> 02:36:12,091
weather and now I'm done with it so I

3787
02:36:12,091 --> 02:36:13,290
don't want that to be able to talk

3788
02:36:13,290 --> 02:36:15,061
anymore and we need to be able to make

3789
02:36:15,061 --> 02:36:18,240
these intelligent decisions on not just

3790
02:36:18,240 --> 02:36:20,280
an app by app basis but a connection by

3791
02:36:20,280 --> 02:36:23,221
connection basis right you want let's

3792
02:36:23,221 --> 02:36:26,391
say you use Facebook because you know

3793
02:36:26,391 --> 02:36:28,471
for whatever judgment we have a lot of

3794
02:36:28,471 --> 02:36:31,440
people might do it you want it to be

3795
02:36:31,440 --> 02:36:33,421
able to connect to Facebook's content

3796
02:36:33,421 --> 02:36:36,030
servers you want to be able to message a

3797
02:36:36,030 --> 02:36:37,530
friend you want to be able to download a

3798
02:36:37,530 --> 02:36:39,480
photograph or whatever but you don't

3799
02:36:39,480 --> 02:36:40,561
want it to be able to talk to an ad

3800
02:36:40,561 --> 02:36:42,480
server you don't want it to talk to an

3801
02:36:42,480 --> 02:36:44,190
analytics server that it's monitoring

3802
02:36:44,190 --> 02:36:45,570
your behavior right you don't want to

3803
02:36:45,570 --> 02:36:46,921
talk to all these third-party things

3804
02:36:46,921 --> 02:36:49,440
because Facebook crams their garbage and

3805
02:36:49,440 --> 02:36:51,421
almost every app that you download and

3806
02:36:51,421 --> 02:36:52,801
you don't even know what's happening

3807
02:36:52,801 --> 02:36:55,080
because you can't see it right and this

3808
02:36:55,080 --> 02:36:56,551
is the problem with the data collection

3809
02:36:56,551 --> 02:37:00,240
used today is there is an industry that

3810
02:37:00,240 --> 02:37:03,000
is built on keeping this invisible and

3811
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:04,860
what we need to do is we need to make

3812
02:37:04,860 --> 02:37:08,610
the activities of our devices whether

3813
02:37:08,610 --> 02:37:09,931
it's a phone whether it's computer or

3814
02:37:09,931 --> 02:37:13,141
whatever more visible and understandable

3815
02:37:13,141 --> 02:37:15,301
to the average person and then give them

3816
02:37:15,301 --> 02:37:17,190
control over it so like if you could see

3817
02:37:17,190 --> 02:37:19,530
your phone right now and at the very

3818
02:37:19,530 --> 02:37:21,240
center of is a little green icon that's

3819
02:37:21,240 --> 02:37:23,761
your you know handset or it's a picture

3820
02:37:23,761 --> 02:37:26,131
your face whatever and then you see all

3821
02:37:26,131 --> 02:37:28,261
these little spokes coming off of it

3822
02:37:28,261 --> 02:37:30,391
that's every app that your phone is

3823
02:37:30,391 --> 02:37:33,570
talking to right now or every app that

3824
02:37:33,570 --> 02:37:34,950
is active on your phone right now and

3825
02:37:34,950 --> 02:37:36,841
all the hosts that it's connecting to

3826
02:37:36,841 --> 02:37:39,450
and you can see right now what's every

3827
02:37:39,450 --> 02:37:41,641
three seconds your phone is checking

3828
02:37:41,641 --> 02:37:43,921
into Facebook and you could just poke

3829
02:37:43,921 --> 02:37:46,110
that app and then BOOM it's not talking

3830
02:37:46,110 --> 02:37:47,190
to Facebook anymore Facebook's not

3831
02:37:47,190 --> 02:37:48,931
allowed Facebook speaking privileges

3832
02:37:48,931 --> 02:37:51,601
have been revoked right you would do

3833
02:37:51,601 --> 02:37:53,730
that we would all do that if there was a

3834
02:37:53,730 --> 02:37:56,551
button on your phone that said do what I

3835
02:37:56,551 --> 02:37:59,011
want but not spy on me you would press

3836
02:37:59,011 --> 02:38:02,250
that button right that button is not a

3837
02:38:02,250 --> 02:38:05,070
does not exist right now and both Google

3838
02:38:05,070 --> 02:38:05,700
and Apple

3839
02:38:05,700 --> 02:38:07,080
unfortunately Apple's a lot better at

3840
02:38:07,080 --> 02:38:11,240
this than Google but neither of them

3841
02:38:11,240 --> 02:38:14,131
allow that button to exist in fact they

3842
02:38:14,131 --> 02:38:15,690
actively interfere with it because they

3843
02:38:15,690 --> 02:38:18,091
say it's a security risk and from a

3844
02:38:18,091 --> 02:38:19,210
particular perspective

3845
02:38:19,210 --> 02:38:21,819
they actually aren't wrong there but

3846
02:38:21,819 --> 02:38:24,670
it's not enough to go you know we have

3847
02:38:24,670 --> 02:38:26,560
to lock that capability off from people

3848
02:38:26,560 --> 02:38:28,210
because we don't trust they would make

3849
02:38:28,210 --> 02:38:29,979
the right decisions we think it's too

3850
02:38:29,979 --> 02:38:31,840
complicated for people to do this we

3851
02:38:31,840 --> 02:38:33,460
think there's too many connections being

3852
02:38:33,460 --> 02:38:36,609
made well that is actually a confession

3853
02:38:36,609 --> 02:38:39,130
of the problem right there if you think

3854
02:38:39,130 --> 02:38:41,170
people can't understand it if you think

3855
02:38:41,170 --> 02:38:42,609
there are too many communications

3856
02:38:42,609 --> 02:38:43,660
happening if you think there's too much

3857
02:38:43,660 --> 02:38:45,970
complexity in there it needs to be

3858
02:38:45,970 --> 02:38:46,720
simplified

3859
02:38:46,720 --> 02:38:49,090
just like the president can't control

3860
02:38:49,090 --> 02:38:50,560
everything like that if you have to be

3861
02:38:50,560 --> 02:38:52,239
the president of the phone and the phone

3862
02:38:52,239 --> 02:38:53,590
is as complex as the United States

3863
02:38:53,590 --> 02:38:56,500
government we have a problem guys this

3864
02:38:56,500 --> 02:38:58,420
should be a much more simple process it

3865
02:38:58,420 --> 02:39:00,370
should be obvious and the fact that it's

3866
02:39:00,370 --> 02:39:02,229
not and the fact that we read story

3867
02:39:02,229 --> 02:39:03,100
after story

3868
02:39:03,100 --> 02:39:04,960
year after year saying all your date has

3869
02:39:04,960 --> 02:39:07,449
been breached here this companies spying

3870
02:39:07,449 --> 02:39:09,580
on you here this companies manipulating

3871
02:39:09,580 --> 02:39:12,220
your purchases or your search results or

3872
02:39:12,220 --> 02:39:14,350
they're hiding these things from your

3873
02:39:14,350 --> 02:39:17,470
timeline or they're influencing your you

3874
02:39:17,470 --> 02:39:18,790
are manipulating it in all of these

3875
02:39:18,790 --> 02:39:22,660
different ways that happens as a result

3876
02:39:22,660 --> 02:39:27,430
of a single problem and that problem is

3877
02:39:27,430 --> 02:39:30,600
in any quality of available information

3878
02:39:30,600 --> 02:39:33,069
they can see everything about you they

3879
02:39:33,069 --> 02:39:34,149
can see everything about what your

3880
02:39:34,149 --> 02:39:35,350
device is doing and they can do whatever

3881
02:39:35,350 --> 02:39:37,300
they want with your device you on the

3882
02:39:37,300 --> 02:39:40,660
other hand owns the device well rather

3883
02:39:40,660 --> 02:39:43,989
you paid for the device but increasingly

3884
02:39:43,989 --> 02:39:46,180
these corporations on it increasingly

3885
02:39:46,180 --> 02:39:47,560
these government's own it and

3886
02:39:47,560 --> 02:39:48,790
increasingly we are living in a world

3887
02:39:48,790 --> 02:39:52,390
where we do all the work right we pay

3888
02:39:52,390 --> 02:39:56,350
all the taxes we pay all the costs but

3889
02:39:56,350 --> 02:39:59,380
we own less and less and nobody

3890
02:39:59,380 --> 02:40:00,520
understands this better than the

3891
02:40:00,520 --> 02:40:02,229
youngest generation well it seems like

3892
02:40:02,229 --> 02:40:04,750
our data became a commodity before we

3893
02:40:04,750 --> 02:40:07,359
understood what it was it became this

3894
02:40:07,359 --> 02:40:09,939
thing that's insanely valuable to Google

3895
02:40:09,939 --> 02:40:11,710
and Facebook and all these social media

3896
02:40:11,710 --> 02:40:14,260
platforms before we understood what we

3897
02:40:14,260 --> 02:40:15,970
were giving up they were making billions

3898
02:40:15,970 --> 02:40:19,149
of dollars and then once that money is

3899
02:40:19,149 --> 02:40:20,770
being earned and once everyone's

3900
02:40:20,770 --> 02:40:22,300
accustomed to this situation

3901
02:40:22,300 --> 02:40:24,100
it's very difficult to pull the reins

3902
02:40:24,100 --> 02:40:25,779
back it's very difficult to turn that

3903
02:40:25,779 --> 02:40:27,210
horse around

3904
02:40:27,210 --> 02:40:29,470
precisely because the money then becomes

3905
02:40:29,470 --> 02:40:31,479
pot right right the information that

3906
02:40:31,479 --> 02:40:32,591
becomes influence

3907
02:40:32,591 --> 02:40:34,120
that also seems to be the same sort of

3908
02:40:34,120 --> 02:40:35,501
situation that would happen with these

3909
02:40:35,501 --> 02:40:37,690
mass surveillance dates once they have

3910
02:40:37,690 --> 02:40:40,120
the access it's going to be incredibly

3911
02:40:40,120 --> 02:40:42,811
difficult for them to relinquish that

3912
02:40:42,811 --> 02:40:45,700
right yeah no you're you're exactly

3913
02:40:45,700 --> 02:40:47,711
correct and this is the the subject of

3914
02:40:47,711 --> 02:40:49,271
the book I mean this is this is the

3915
02:40:49,271 --> 02:40:50,591
permanent record and this is where it

3916
02:40:50,591 --> 02:40:53,370
came from this is how it came to exist

3917
02:40:53,370 --> 02:40:58,051
the story of our lifetimes is how

3918
02:40:58,051 --> 02:41:02,320
intentionally by design a number of

3919
02:41:02,320 --> 02:41:04,990
institutions both governmental and

3920
02:41:04,990 --> 02:41:07,120
corporate realized it was in their

3921
02:41:07,120 --> 02:41:10,301
mutual interest to conceal their data

3922
02:41:10,301 --> 02:41:14,051
collection activities to increase the

3923
02:41:14,051 --> 02:41:16,511
breadth and depth of their sensor

3924
02:41:16,511 --> 02:41:18,370
networks that were sort of spread out

3925
02:41:18,370 --> 02:41:20,591
through society remember back in the day

3926
02:41:20,591 --> 02:41:23,200
intelligence collection in the United

3927
02:41:23,200 --> 02:41:24,940
States even at Sigyn used to mean

3928
02:41:24,940 --> 02:41:27,730
sending an FBI agent right to put

3929
02:41:27,730 --> 02:41:29,440
alligator clips on an embassy building

3930
02:41:29,440 --> 02:41:32,530
or sending in somebody disguised as a

3931
02:41:32,530 --> 02:41:35,650
workman and they put a bug in a building

3932
02:41:35,650 --> 02:41:39,341
or they built a satellite listening site

3933
02:41:39,341 --> 02:41:41,110
right we called these foreign said were

3934
02:41:41,110 --> 02:41:44,080
foreign satellite collection we're on

3935
02:41:44,080 --> 02:41:46,171
the desert somewhere they built a big

3936
02:41:46,171 --> 02:41:49,240
parabolic collector and it's just

3937
02:41:49,240 --> 02:41:51,131
listening to satellite emissions right

3938
02:41:51,131 --> 02:41:53,801
but these satellite emissions these

3939
02:41:53,801 --> 02:41:56,740
satellite links were owned by militaries

3940
02:41:56,740 --> 02:41:58,660
they were exclusive to governments right

3941
02:41:58,660 --> 02:42:01,181
it wasn't affecting everybody broadly

3942
02:42:01,181 --> 02:42:04,001
all surveillance was targeted because it

3943
02:42:04,001 --> 02:42:07,330
had to be what changed with technology

3944
02:42:07,330 --> 02:42:10,021
is that surveillance could now become

3945
02:42:10,021 --> 02:42:12,820
indiscriminate it could become dragnet

3946
02:42:12,820 --> 02:42:15,971
it could become bulk collection which

3947
02:42:15,971 --> 02:42:17,230
should become one of the dirtiest

3948
02:42:17,230 --> 02:42:19,811
phrases in the language if we have any

3949
02:42:19,811 --> 02:42:22,200
kind of decency but we were

3950
02:42:22,200 --> 02:42:26,171
intentionally this was intentionally

3951
02:42:26,171 --> 02:42:28,301
concealed from us right the government

3952
02:42:28,301 --> 02:42:30,091
did it they used classification

3953
02:42:30,091 --> 02:42:32,501
companies did it they intentionally

3954
02:42:32,501 --> 02:42:35,051
didn't talk about it they denied these

3955
02:42:35,051 --> 02:42:37,391
things were going they said you agreed

3956
02:42:37,391 --> 02:42:39,851
to this and you didn't greeted nothing

3957
02:42:39,851 --> 02:42:43,001
like this I'm sorry right they go we put

3958
02:42:43,001 --> 02:42:45,050
that Terms of Service page up and you

3959
02:42:45,050 --> 02:42:47,539
that you clicked a button that said I

3960
02:42:47,539 --> 02:42:50,000
agree because you were trying to open an

3961
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:51,770
account so you could talk to your

3962
02:42:51,770 --> 02:42:53,659
friends you were trying to get driving

3963
02:42:53,659 --> 02:42:54,979
directions you were trying to get an

3964
02:42:54,979 --> 02:42:56,689
email account you weren't trying to

3965
02:42:56,689 --> 02:42:59,810
agree to some 600 page legal form that

3966
02:42:59,810 --> 02:43:01,609
even if you read you wouldn't understand

3967
02:43:01,609 --> 02:43:03,409
and it doesn't matter even if you did

3968
02:43:03,409 --> 02:43:05,029
understand because one of the very first

3969
02:43:05,029 --> 02:43:07,100
paragraphs and I said this agreement can

3970
02:43:07,100 --> 02:43:09,380
be changed at any time unilaterally

3971
02:43:09,380 --> 02:43:11,239
without your consent by the company

3972
02:43:11,239 --> 02:43:15,619
right they have built a legal paradigm

3973
02:43:15,619 --> 02:43:19,539
that presumes records collected about us

3974
02:43:19,539 --> 02:43:24,649
do not belong to us this is sort of one

3975
02:43:24,649 --> 02:43:26,119
of the core principles on which mass

3976
02:43:26,119 --> 02:43:28,010
surveillance from the government's

3977
02:43:28,010 --> 02:43:29,270
perspective in the United States is

3978
02:43:29,270 --> 02:43:31,250
legal and you have to understand that

3979
02:43:31,250 --> 02:43:32,239
all the stuff we talked about today

3980
02:43:32,239 --> 02:43:34,189
government says everything they do is

3981
02:43:34,189 --> 02:43:37,310
legal right and they go so it's fine our

3982
02:43:37,310 --> 02:43:39,560
perspectives the public should be well

3983
02:43:39,560 --> 02:43:41,659
that's actually the problem because this

3984
02:43:41,659 --> 02:43:42,289
isn't okay

3985
02:43:42,289 --> 02:43:44,689
the scandal isn't how they're breaking

3986
02:43:44,689 --> 02:43:46,819
the law the scandal is that they don't

3987
02:43:46,819 --> 02:43:49,850
have to break the law and the way they

3988
02:43:49,850 --> 02:43:51,199
say they're not breaking the law is

3989
02:43:51,199 --> 02:43:52,430
something called the third party

3990
02:43:52,430 --> 02:43:56,829
doctrine the third party doctrine is a

3991
02:43:57,399 --> 02:44:00,050
legal principle and derived from a case

3992
02:44:00,050 --> 02:44:02,600
and I believe the 1970s called Smith

3993
02:44:02,600 --> 02:44:07,039
versus Maryland and Smith was this

3994
02:44:07,039 --> 02:44:09,409
knucklehead who was harassing this lady

3995
02:44:09,409 --> 02:44:13,100
making phone calls to her house and when

3996
02:44:13,100 --> 02:44:14,840
she would pick up you just I don't know

3997
02:44:14,840 --> 02:44:16,340
is that their heavy breathing whatever

3998
02:44:16,340 --> 02:44:20,029
like a classic creeper and you know it

3999
02:44:20,029 --> 02:44:22,550
was terrifying this poor lady so she

4000
02:44:22,550 --> 02:44:25,789
calls the cops and says one day I got

4001
02:44:25,789 --> 02:44:27,229
one of these phone calls and then I see

4002
02:44:27,229 --> 02:44:28,039
this car

4003
02:44:28,039 --> 02:44:30,710
creeping past my house on the street and

4004
02:44:30,710 --> 02:44:32,960
she got a license-plate number so she

4005
02:44:32,960 --> 02:44:34,640
goes the cops and she goes is this the

4006
02:44:34,640 --> 02:44:38,000
guy and the cops again they're trying to

4007
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:41,510
do a good thing here they look up his

4008
02:44:41,510 --> 02:44:44,510
license-plate number and they find out

4009
02:44:44,510 --> 02:44:46,340
where this guy is and then they go what

4010
02:44:46,340 --> 02:44:47,750
phone number is registered to that house

4011
02:44:47,750 --> 02:44:49,100
and they go to the phone company and

4012
02:44:49,100 --> 02:44:50,539
they say can you give us this record the

4013
02:44:50,539 --> 02:44:53,210
phone company says yeah sure and it's

4014
02:44:53,210 --> 02:44:55,420
the guy the cops got their man

4015
02:44:55,420 --> 02:44:58,210
right huh so they go arrest this guy and

4016
02:44:58,210 --> 02:45:00,820
then in court his lawyer brings all this

4017
02:45:00,820 --> 02:45:08,560
stuff up and they go um you did this

4018
02:45:08,560 --> 02:45:10,360
without a warrant that was sorry that

4019
02:45:10,360 --> 02:45:12,850
was that was the the problem was they

4020
02:45:12,850 --> 02:45:13,990
went to the phone company they got the

4021
02:45:13,990 --> 02:45:15,220
records without a warrant they just

4022
02:45:15,220 --> 02:45:17,080
asked for it or they subpoenaed it right

4023
02:45:17,080 --> 02:45:19,060
some lower standard of legal review and

4024
02:45:19,060 --> 02:45:21,430
the company gave it to him and got the

4025
02:45:21,430 --> 02:45:25,600
guy they march amok in jail and they

4026
02:45:25,600 --> 02:45:27,310
could have gotten a warrant right but it

4027
02:45:27,310 --> 02:45:28,780
was just expedience they just didn't

4028
02:45:28,780 --> 02:45:30,310
want to take the time with small-town

4029
02:45:30,310 --> 02:45:32,410
cops you can understand how it happens

4030
02:45:32,410 --> 02:45:33,490
they know the guy's a creep or they just

4031
02:45:33,490 --> 02:45:37,180
want to get him off to jail and so they

4032
02:45:37,180 --> 02:45:38,050
made him I said but the government

4033
02:45:38,050 --> 02:45:39,580
doesn't want to let go they fight on

4034
02:45:39,580 --> 02:45:45,280
this and they go it wasn't actually they

4035
02:45:45,280 --> 02:45:48,430
weren't his records and so because they

4036
02:45:48,430 --> 02:45:50,200
didn't belong to him he didn't have a

4037
02:45:50,200 --> 02:45:54,130
Fourth Amendment right to demand a

4038
02:45:54,130 --> 02:45:56,380
warrant be issued for them they were the

4039
02:45:56,380 --> 02:45:58,030
company's records and the company

4040
02:45:58,030 --> 02:46:00,070
provided them voluntarily and hence no

4041
02:46:00,070 --> 02:46:01,750
warrant was required because you can

4042
02:46:01,750 --> 02:46:03,340
give whatever you want without a warrant

4043
02:46:03,340 --> 02:46:05,560
as long as it's yours now here's the

4044
02:46:05,560 --> 02:46:08,560
problem the government extrapolated a

4045
02:46:08,560 --> 02:46:11,530
principle in a single case of a single

4046
02:46:11,530 --> 02:46:14,260
known suspected criminal who had they

4047
02:46:14,260 --> 02:46:16,990
had real good reasons suspect suspect

4048
02:46:16,990 --> 02:46:22,030
was their guy and used that to go to a

4049
02:46:22,030 --> 02:46:23,800
company and get records from them and

4050
02:46:23,800 --> 02:46:26,020
establish the precedent these records

4051
02:46:26,020 --> 02:46:28,180
don't belong to the guy they belong to

4052
02:46:28,180 --> 02:46:30,130
the company and then they said well if

4053
02:46:30,130 --> 02:46:32,500
one person doesn't have a Fourth

4054
02:46:32,500 --> 02:46:33,970
Amendment interest in records held by a

4055
02:46:33,970 --> 02:46:37,630
company no one does and so the company

4056
02:46:37,630 --> 02:46:39,880
then has absolute proprietary ownership

4057
02:46:39,880 --> 02:46:41,830
of all of these records about all of our

4058
02:46:41,830 --> 02:46:43,210
lives and remember this is back in the

4059
02:46:43,210 --> 02:46:45,910
1970s you know the internet hardly

4060
02:46:45,910 --> 02:46:48,340
exists in these kind of contexts

4061
02:46:48,340 --> 02:46:50,590
smartphones you know don't exist modern

4062
02:46:50,590 --> 02:46:53,050
society modern communications don't

4063
02:46:53,050 --> 02:46:55,330
exist this is the very beginning of the

4064
02:46:55,330 --> 02:46:59,939
technological era and flash-forward now

4065
02:46:59,939 --> 02:47:03,390
40 years

4066
02:47:04,750 --> 02:47:07,270
and they are still relying on this

4067
02:47:07,270 --> 02:47:08,590
precedent about this one

4068
02:47:08,590 --> 02:47:11,500
you know pervy creeper to go nobody has

4069
02:47:11,500 --> 02:47:13,090
a privacy right for anything that's held

4070
02:47:13,090 --> 02:47:15,820
by a company and so long as they do that

4071
02:47:15,820 --> 02:47:17,080
companies are going to be

4072
02:47:17,080 --> 02:47:19,060
extraordinarily powerful and they're

4073
02:47:19,060 --> 02:47:20,380
going to be extraordinarily abusive and

4074
02:47:20,380 --> 02:47:21,520
this is something that people don't get

4075
02:47:21,520 --> 02:47:24,490
they go oh well it's data collection

4076
02:47:24,490 --> 02:47:27,010
right they're exploiting data this is

4077
02:47:27,010 --> 02:47:31,000
data about human lives mistake about

4078
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:33,250
people these records are about you it's

4079
02:47:33,250 --> 02:47:37,060
not data that's being exploited it's

4080
02:47:37,060 --> 02:47:39,660
people that are being exploited it's not

4081
02:47:39,660 --> 02:47:43,720
data that's being manipulated it's you

4082
02:47:43,720 --> 02:47:48,130
that's being manipulated and this this

4083
02:47:48,130 --> 02:47:50,140
is this is something that I think a lot

4084
02:47:50,140 --> 02:47:52,810
of people are beginning to understand

4085
02:47:52,810 --> 02:47:54,520
the problem is the companies in the

4086
02:47:54,520 --> 02:47:55,660
government's are still pretending they

4087
02:47:55,660 --> 02:47:57,400
don't understand were disagreeing with

4088
02:47:57,400 --> 02:47:59,230
this and this is reminds me of something

4089
02:47:59,230 --> 02:48:01,780
that one of my old friends John Perry

4090
02:48:01,780 --> 02:48:05,950
Barlow who served with me at the freedom

4091
02:48:05,950 --> 02:48:07,360
of the press foundation I'm the

4092
02:48:07,360 --> 02:48:10,540
president of the board he used to say to

4093
02:48:10,540 --> 02:48:14,920
me which is you can't awaken someone

4094
02:48:14,920 --> 02:48:17,440
who's pretending to be asleep he said

4095
02:48:17,440 --> 02:48:18,790
it's an old Native American saying

4096
02:48:18,790 --> 02:48:21,760
that's a great expression it's a good

4097
02:48:21,760 --> 02:48:23,410
way that I think that's a good way to

4098
02:48:23,410 --> 02:48:26,380
end this thank you very much for doing

4099
02:48:26,380 --> 02:48:28,060
this I really appreciate it please tell

4100
02:48:28,060 --> 02:48:29,950
everybody the title of your book and

4101
02:48:29,950 --> 02:48:31,800
it's it's available right now

4102
02:48:31,800 --> 02:48:34,390
sure yes it is it's on shelves

4103
02:48:34,390 --> 02:48:36,040
everywhere at least until the government

4104
02:48:36,040 --> 02:48:38,350
finds some other way to ban it it is

4105
02:48:38,350 --> 02:48:42,400
called a permanent record and I hope

4106
02:48:42,400 --> 02:48:44,620
you'll read it I will read it and I

4107
02:48:44,620 --> 02:48:46,750
think what you've done is incredibly

4108
02:48:46,750 --> 02:48:47,980
brave and I think you're a very

4109
02:48:47,980 --> 02:48:50,680
important part of history I think when

4110
02:48:50,680 --> 02:48:53,500
all is said and done what you did and

4111
02:48:53,500 --> 02:48:56,440
what you exposed is gonna change the way

4112
02:48:56,440 --> 02:48:59,410
we view mass surveillance change the way

4113
02:48:59,410 --> 02:49:01,900
we view government oversight and it

4114
02:49:01,900 --> 02:49:04,030
changed the way we view the distribution

4115
02:49:04,030 --> 02:49:05,950
of information I really think it's very

4116
02:49:05,950 --> 02:49:08,410
very important and it was an honor to

4117
02:49:08,410 --> 02:49:09,730
