1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,659
The Joe Rogan Experience did Lily pep

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:06,359
die in the ring or something that name

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,639
stands out to me for some reason I don't

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,679
believe so okay Benny Perrette died in

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,480
the ring Benny Perrette was killed by

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,940
Emile Griffith uh Emil Griffith beat him

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,560
to death in the ring after Benny

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,900
Perrette uh teased him for being gay he

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,800
kept uh talking [ __ ] about him being gay

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,539
and he beat the [ __ ] out of him he beat

11
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,439
him oh was he gay I believe so I believe

12
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,080
so I think that was the rumor

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,840
wow he beat him to death but that that

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,940
wasn't illegal right nope I mean he

15
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,140
wasn't trying to he's trying to knock

16
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,020
him out but it's a I forget what they

17
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,399
call that fight see if you can find that

18
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:42,660
fight because that's a rough one to

19
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,059
watch the end Emile Griffin was that the

20
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:47,040
fight that like chained boxing but they

21
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,480
had to like like crack down on like

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,300
safety rules no no the one that did that

23
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,600
was uh uh Ray Boom Boom Mancini versus

24
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,340
duck Kim

25
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,219
that was the one where um duck who Kim

26
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,000
died and uh I think that was when they

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,799
started to go to 12 rounds I think they

28
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,600
go went to 12 rounds slightly after that

29
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,340
because they were they were doing 15

30
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,159
rounds before and I think uh duck who

31
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,500
Kim died in the 13th or 14th round I

32
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,420
forget which round I think they decided

33
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,400
that 12 rounds would be the right one so

34
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,340
this is Emil Griffith versus

35
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,400
Benny Perrette and this is the one where

36
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,340
uh you know he was taunting him and Emil

37
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,259
Griffith just [ __ ] people I'm

38
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:29,400
guessing the guy on the right was the

39
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,780
gay guy

40
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,119
the guy on the right is Emil Griffith

41
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,820
yes okay that's that's the gay guy with

42
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,860
the I I don't know if he's gay but

43
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,540
that's what that's what he was being

44
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,460
pleased about yeah and that was he was

45
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,600
definitely being teased about that but

46
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,979
that was the rumor that he was but look

47
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,439
dude he just beats the [ __ ] [ __ ] oh

48
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,720
look at this so he's stuck in the ropes

49
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,820
and Emil Griff is just teeing off on him

50
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,860
while he's out so he's trapped in the

51
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,020
ropes and he collapses and then he's

52
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,119
dead he's dead right now yeah he's dead

53
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,640
man wow wow they beat him to death

54
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,740
watch that again Watch that combination

55
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,380
again because it's so crazy uppercut and

56
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,420
then he he backs up right hand yeah

57
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,340
right this right here right here should

58
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,420
have stopped it right right hand right

59
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,800
hand this is crazy right hand right in

60
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,300
yeah he's trapped the only thing keeping

61
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,879
him up is the punches the punches are so

62
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,160
hard they're they're keeping his body

63
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,739
upright as he's leaning up against the

64
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:24,840
Rope because he dead right here bang

65
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,940
well he's out right here right like

66
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,319
right there you could have stopped it

67
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,360
right there right there for sure right

68
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,400
here turning away and he's hitting it

69
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,260
with bomb after bomb and he keeps going

70
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,200
one two one two one two one two I mean

71
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,480
he's just swinging at him afterwards and

72
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,580
the refs just sit there like this yeah

73
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,739
there's been some horrific moments like

74
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:45,239
that dude remember that who was the one

75
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:46,620
guy I can't remember his [ __ ] name

76
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,980
but he Ray Mercer versus Tommy Morrison

77
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,780
wait a minute that's that's from Rocky

78
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,760
right yeah no no I never saw that one

79
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,379
that might be the worst one ever I'm

80
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:58,440
talking about the guy who he he didn't

81
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,560
die in the ring but but he had like all

82
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,379
this promise oh Gerald McClellan maybe

83
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:06,060
maybe that's what I'm saying 100 of you

84
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,379
talking about yeah he was the guy that

85
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:09,840
was a rival for Roy Jones Jr so as Roy

86
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,060
Jones Jr was a champion he was a champ

87
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,760
and he fought Nigel Ben and he almost

88
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,459
put Nigel Ben out in the first round but

89
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,560
they collided heads at one point in the

90
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,920
fight and Nigel Ben uh hit him with some

91
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,659
real good punches and he went down took

92
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:26,519
a knee and then he went back to his

93
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,000
corner and he he quit and they couldn't

94
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,220
believe that he like he took a 10 count

95
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,840
and everyone's like I can't believe he's

96
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,400
taking a 10 count and he went back to

97
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,780
his corner and he was so [ __ ] up

98
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,120
yeah this is him so he had Nigel been in

99
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,680
all sorts of trouble knocked him out of

100
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,659
the ring right Nigel Ben was one of the

101
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,519
toughest [ __ ] to ever box he

102
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,580
got back in the ring and survived so

103
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,440
Nigel Ben knocked out of the ring and

104
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,900
here's him after that so Jerry McClellan

105
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,000
is just emptying the [ __ ] gas tank

106
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,980
here just swinging with everything he

107
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,500
had and Gerald McClellan was all [ __ ]

108
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,480
murderous puncher he knocked everybody

109
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,580
out so he was assuming he was about to

110
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,040
knock Nigel Ben out too but Nigel Ben

111
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,080
wasn't going anywhere and so Gerald

112
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,299
McClellan got [ __ ] drained and then

113
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,040
Nigel started catching him look at that

114
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,320
left hook Nigel catches him and Gerald

115
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,260
tags him again right hand uppercut but

116
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,540
Nigel van just kept coming and look he

117
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,860
catches him with that right hand look at

118
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,780
that left hook imagine being that hurt

119
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,940
in the first round and Nigel Ben just

120
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,040
comes storming out later in the fight

121
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,259
yeah that's it's crazy the resilience

122
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,900
crazy the endurance so Gerald McClellan

123
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,520
emptied this gas tank and Nigel's

124
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,720
catching him now he catches him with a

125
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,919
big left hook

126
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,199
and at one point in time they collided

127
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,780
heads and it was a bad one it was like a

128
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,220
bang

129
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,380
you think that's what did it no no no it

130
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,360
was all these punches for sure but it

131
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,880
was like I think it was a collision of

132
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,620
heads as well that that someone had

133
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,139
identified that was really bad but he

134
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:57,600
hit him with some [ __ ] bombs

135
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,240
and look he dropped him again so Gerald

136
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,220
eventually comes back and drops Nigel

137
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,620
again the eighth round and Nigel gets

138
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,540
back up and he's like still not going

139
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,160
anywhere boom hits him with the left

140
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,440
hook this is after getting dropped again

141
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,880
imagine hitting the [ __ ] with

142
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,020
everything you got look at this

143
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,820
combination boom Nigel over the top of

144
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,900
that right hand

145
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,060
so that what the point is this was a

146
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,199
[ __ ] war and there's another

147
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,720
brilliant one so we see like where he

148
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,460
takes a knee

149
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,199
boom look at that right hand this is

150
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,000
[ __ ] another right hand so that's

151
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,320
where it was that's where he takes a

152
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,720
knee yeah this is sad so he decided to

153
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,120
stay down

154
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,240
so he gets hit he gets I guess he got up

155
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,380
for the first one right is that what

156
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,539
they're saying

157
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,120
oh so he goes down a second time

158
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,620
so this is the second time and then look

159
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,419
you see him like wincing in pain like

160
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:46,860
holding his head and that's when he

161
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,300
decided to stay down

162
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,039
and so everybody's like I can't believe

163
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:52,919
he you know he quit on his knee like

164
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,479
that but then he went back into his

165
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,479
corner and he slumped and uh he really

166
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:59,460
never recovered he went to the hospital

167
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,259
and he's alive still but he's like

168
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:03,780
severely disabled and I believe he's

169
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,660
blind what did it cause like a brain

170
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,660
bleed yeah yeah yeah I mean that's the

171
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,340
risk that these guys have taken man I

172
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,620
mean that's a crazy sport you're you're

173
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,419
throwing Haymakers at each other with

174
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:17,160
like thick padding over the top of it

175
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,680
and that's that's him today

176
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,199
and this like greatly affected Roy Jones

177
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,539
Jr too because you got to think that Roy

178
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:27,240
and him almost fought right like they

179
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,740
that was like a big super fight that

180
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,819
people were setting up for the future

181
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:33,180
and Roy and him down the line did wind

182
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,560
up fighting that could have been Roy or

183
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,180
that it could have been Gerald like it

184
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,440
could have been neither one of them yeah

185
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,780
like when when two guys are that good

186
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,759
and they're swinging the way those guys

187
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,199
were at each other my money would have

188
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,960
still been on Roy though

189
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,060
Roy and his pride was [ __ ] stupid

190
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,539
good he was ridiculous and this Prime no

191
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:53,400
one can touch him he he would win entire

192
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,500
rounds without him being hit to me you

193
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,539
know what I'll compare Roy to is

194
00:06:57,539 --> 00:06:59,360
Anderson Silva

195
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,860
similar in that way like they were just

196
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,080
so dominant for a while and he would win

197
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,300
in such stylish fashion you know where

198
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,919
it was it wasn't just that he was

199
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,500
winning but he just made you look silly

200
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,780
you know he was doing movie [ __ ] he was

201
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,639
doing movie [ __ ] Roy put his hand behind

202
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,560
his back and then knocked out with one

203
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,600
punch yeah put his hand behind his back

204
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,220
ducked and then popped him with a right

205
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,300
hand and knocked him out but just like

206
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,620
both his like eventually it catches up

207
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,360
to you where it's like you know it's

208
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,740
like you hit an age where like you don't

209
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,599
realize but you just a millisecond

210
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,360
slower yeah there's that there's also

211
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,699
this other speculation that speculation

212
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,560
is that he went up to heavyweight to

213
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,780
fight John Ruiz and so he had to pack on

214
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,880
weight and then he went back down to

215
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,300
light heavyweight and I think the losing

216
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,400
the weight to get back down diminished

217
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,860
him severely and then he fought Antonio

218
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,919
Tarver and Antonio Tarboro was a

219
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,020
murderous puncher and a [ __ ] of

220
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,259
a boxer Antonio Tarver could box and he

221
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:57,000
said in the ring to Roy because they had

222
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,680
had one fight previously where it went

223
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,440
to a decision and uh you know and Roy

224
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,960
had some excuses I guess and so he says

225
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,180
in the ring for the second fight he got

226
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,099
excuses tonight Roy

227
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:10,620
the referee goes any questions any

228
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,419
questions and he goes got any excuses

229
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:13,740
tonight Roy and Roy didn't say anything

230
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,259
and Tarver wind up knocking him out and

231
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:17,220
then after that he just kept getting

232
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,379
knocked out right he got knocked out bad

233
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:21,060
after that what do you think that is

234
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,759
when after somebody gets knocked out

235
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,740
it's almost like it's easier to knock

236
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,419
him out after today well he fought Glenn

237
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:30,139
Johnson after that who is a very

238
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:34,440
talented uh Contender who people like I

239
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,940
think Glenn Johnson was a little older

240
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,740
at the time and maybe people overlooked

241
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,680
him he like he really had great success

242
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,779
like later in his career but Glenn

243
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:44,940
Johnson knocked out Roy in a scary

244
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,279
knockout pull that one up Glenn Johnson

245
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,620
Roy Jones Jr that was a scary one

246
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,660
because this was after the Tarver one

247
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,240
but the Tarver one he was kind of he was

248
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,540
conscious but he was [ __ ] up I mean

249
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,519
Tarver cracked him and he went down but

250
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,440
he was out right but he was moving

251
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,600
around this one's even scarier because

252
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,580
he bangs the back of his head when he

253
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,660
goes down

254
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,640
and this was the comeback fight right

255
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,860
and so Glenn Johnson was like a suitable

256
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,800
comeback opponent but nobody told Glenn

257
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,600
Johnson that like Glenn Johnson came to

258
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,100
that fight to win and Glenn Johnson has

259
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,140
his high guard he's like really

260
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,060
difficult style to deal with and super

261
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,860
super tough guy

262
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,320
just very very skillful and you know

263
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,360
this was Roy coming off of getting ko'd

264
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,800
and whenever a guy comes off of getting

265
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,920
ko'd the odds of him getting KO to again

266
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,560
go up I don't know it depends on the

267
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,420
person some of it doesn't go up at all

268
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,339
some of them it only goes up slightly

269
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:40,800
but some of them it goes up a lot for

270
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,180
whatever reason it might be the damage

271
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,220
they took from the first knockout it

272
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,260
could be a lot of factors look at this

273
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,519
boom he hits him in that right hand look

274
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,680
how he goes out

275
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,920
he goes out stiff he banged his head off

276
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,540
the ground like watch that again because

277
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,060
it is a [ __ ] brutal series of punches

278
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,500
he hits him with

279
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,420
back here goes so he gets him up against

280
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,040
the ropes sets him up for the right hand

281
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,820
and boom he's out one hard right hand to

282
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,860
the side of the head and Roy's out

283
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,440
that was a rough one but that's nothing

284
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,580
Mercer versus Tommy Morris I think it's

285
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,320
like your brain going we're not taking

286
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,120
any chances probably because there's

287
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,040
probably some something to that but get

288
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,320
ray Mercer versus Tommy Morrison this

289
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,420
one was one of the worst and this one

290
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,120
was one after the movie so Ray Mercer

291
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,760
people thought about him as like this

292
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,560
like gold medalist in the Olympics

293
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,260
murderous puncher like he was a guy

294
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,720
who's on the up like he was coming up

295
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,880
and somehow or another they set him up

296
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,760
with Tommy Morrison who was a very good

297
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,860
boxer and had beaten some good guys but

298
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,540
he was just coming off of this movie so

299
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,120
he was the [ __ ] the in the Rocky

300
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,980
movies and he's fighting a guy that's

301
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,839
just been doing nothing but boxing now

302
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:51,000
Tommy Morrison's a movie star now and

303
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,880
he's a young guy he's got to be

304
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,560
distracted I mean he's got to be more

305
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,839
focused right and he's fighting a guy

306
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,279
that he probably would have lost to

307
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,200
anyway because Ray Mercer was a

308
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,760
[ __ ] and so Tommy is doing well

309
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,820
in the fight for a while but then Mercer

310
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,800
eventually catches him because Tommy

311
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,480
starts getting tired and this one of the

312
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,220
things about Tommy Morrison if you look

313
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,440
at Tommy Morrison in the early stages of

314
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,600
his fights he was always better he would

315
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,860
fade

316
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,079
and eventually Ray Mercer catches him

317
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:20,459
and he hits him with that right hand and

318
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:22,800
watch this boom he's in trouble here

319
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,920
right boom boom boom boom now this is

320
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,279
why it's the worst one ever oh bro he's

321
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,140
Tangled Up in the ropes and the referee

322
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,240
is too small to pull Mercer off of him

323
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,459
so he hits him with multiple punches

324
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:37,200
wise how cold look at this this is over

325
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,839
now referee doesn't get in there look

326
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,760
look how he gets in there the referees

327
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,040
just say hey you stop hey you he's

328
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,140
scared because he's a little old guy he

329
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,300
shouldn't be referee in this fight these

330
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,040
are two Elite heavyweights these are

331
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,440
enormous men and this poor referee is

332
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,839
old got a little pot belly he doesn't

333
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,279
want to dive in there and get [ __ ]

334
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:59,880
murked yeah yeah and so because of that

335
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,880
Tommy Morrison takes Haymakers look he's

336
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,279
out cold and Ray Mercer is just full

337
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,920
blast teeing off and another left hook

338
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,899
after that while the referee was holding

339
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:11,339
onto his arms

340
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:13,140
bro

341
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,180
that might be the worst did he survive

342
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,300
he lived but he was never the same boxer

343
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,760
again no no way he he beat some good

344
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,079
guys after that he actually beat George

345
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,519
Foreman after that

346
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,380
yeah old George Foreman old George

347
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,959
Foreman he won a decision off of uh old

348
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:29,339
George Foreman look at that left hook

349
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:32,160
boom boom boom right hand I mean this is

350
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,440
horrendous dude this is we're looking at

351
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,180
it from a different angle now look at

352
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,640
this I mean come on man boom and then

353
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,600
still

354
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,540
he's fully out cold that he got hit four

355
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,060
or five times clean this is like Benny

356
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,339
perret all over again this easily could

357
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:50,040
have been the end of his life yeah it

358
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,060
usually could have been and probably

359
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,399
changed his brain because right here

360
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,320
like I mean what is this rough weight

361
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,540
doing I mean but seriously dude like

362
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,060
